"T2" is a community driven fork from the ROCK Linux project which aims at
simplicity and clean and lightweight implementation instead of adding every
random feature that comes to someone's mind. "T2" aims to be open for active
maintainers and currently seven (!) people have write access to the "T2"
Subversion repository (which to our knowledge are six people more than a ROCK
Linux tree currently has). This organization provides for delivery of quick
bug and security fixes (not relying on a single person in the process),
offers a nice development climate and does not loose version control
on renames (as the submaster thing currently does).

"T2" is an intern project name for "try two - (second try)" or "technology
two". A more public relation aware name will be chosen later as soon as
we find an interesting one.
