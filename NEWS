At October the 3rd, German Unification Day, 1:56:48 MEST the "T2" project
tagged the internal milestone 2.1.0-alpha ("Way to heaven"). This was just
a few hours after the estimated date that was October the 2nd - Valentin's
brithday ;-)

"T2" is a community driven fork from the ROCK Linux project which aims at
simplicity and clean implementaton instead of adding every random feature
that comes to someone's mind. "T2" aims to be open for active maintainers
and currently seven (!) people have write access to the "T2" Subversion
repository (which to our knowledge are six people more than a ROCK Linux
tree currently has). This organization provides for delivery of quick
bug and security fixes (not reling on a single person in the process),
offers a nice development climate and does not loose version control
on renames (as the sumbaster thing currently does).

The tag was done after a huge ammount of cleanup work after the fork from
ROCK Linux which happend at revision r3594 - July the 21th - 21:55:13 MEST.

The install and desktop target build reasonable well - on x86, sparc,
sparc64 (with a bit more work until -stable) as well as powerpc.

Major changes from ROCK Linux 2.1-devel when we forked:

 * no people named repositories - most packages should now be sorted
   into category repositories - which so far scale quite well

 * no package fork / package split stuff, no pseudo cross native
   compiler hacks

 ... TO BE FILLED ...

The next milestones are schedules for:

 * 2.1.0-beta, October the 23th
 * 2.1.0, October the 30th (intentinally Rene's birthday ;-)
