At October the 3rd, German Unification Day, 1:56:48 MEST "T2" 2.1.0-alpha
("Way to heaven") got tagged. Just a few hours after the estimated date that
was October the 2nd - Valentin's brithday ;-)

"T2" is a community driven fork from the ROCK Linux project which aims at
simplicity and clean implementaton instead of adding every random feature
that comes to someone's mind.

The tag was done after a huge ammount of cleanup work after the fork from
ROCK Linux which happend at revision r3594 - July the 21th - 21:55:13 MEST.

Major changes from ROCK Linux 2.1-devel when we forked:

 * no people named repositories - most packages should now be sorted
   into category repositories - which so far scale quite well

 * no package fork / package split stuff, no pseudo cross native
   compiler hacks

 ... TO BE FILLED ...
