[I] Libraries and daemons to implement Contact Management in Akonadi

[T] Akonadi Contacts is a library that effectively bridges the type-agnostic
[T] API of the Akonadi client libraries and the domain-specific KContacts
[T] library. It provides jobs, models and other helpers to make working with
[T] contacts and addressbooks through Akonadi easier.
