[I] Photo Album for easy organization of your images

[T] If you have hundreds or even thousands of images on your hard drive, it
[T] becomes impossible to remember the story behind every single image or the
[T] names of the persons photographed. KPhotoAlbum was created to help you
[T] describe your images and then search the big pile of pictures quickly and
[T] efficiently.
