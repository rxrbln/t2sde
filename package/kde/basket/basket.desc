[I] An application for organizing ideas

[T] BasKet Note Pads is an application that provides several baskets into
[T] which the user can drop all sorts of notes: rich text, links, images,
[T] sounds, files, colors, application launchers, and more. Objects in the
[T] baskets can be edited, copied, and rearranged. This application can
[T] be used to quickly store Web objects (such as links, text, or images)
[T] or notes, and it can also help clean up a clutered desktop. It is also
[T] useful for collecting information for a report. The data in baskets can
[T] be shared with co-workers by exporting them to HTML.
