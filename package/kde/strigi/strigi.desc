[I] A desktop and indexer independent desktop search engine

[T] Strigi is a desktop and indexer independent desktop search engine. Its
[T] main features include very fast crawling, a very small memory footprint,
[T] no hammering of the system, and pluggable backends (currently clucene
[T] and hyperestraier was provided). Communication between the daemon and
[T] search program is done over an abstract interface which is desktop
[T] independent. A small Perl program with an example of how to query the
[T] database is included along with an example KDE client application and
[T] a KIO interface.
