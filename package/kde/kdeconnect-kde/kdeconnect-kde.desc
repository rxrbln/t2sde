[I] Multi-platform app that allows your devices to communicate

[T] KDE Connect makes your phone and computer work better together: share your
[T] clipboard and access files across devices, turn your phone into a remote

[T] back of your couch, see your phone notifications from your computer, and
[T] much more.
