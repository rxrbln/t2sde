[I] An alarm message, command, and email scheduler for KDE

[T] KAlarm lets you configure personal messages to be displayed, commands
[T] to be executed, or emails to be sent, at scheduled times. It allows
[T] you to choose the message font and color, how often to repeat, whether
[T] to display an advance reminder, whether to speak the message or play a
[T] sound when it is displayed, and whether to cancel the alarm if it can't
[T] be triggered on time (e.g. If you are logged out at the time). As well
[T] as using the graphical interface to configure alarms, you can use the
[T] command line, and there is a DCOP interface for other applications.
