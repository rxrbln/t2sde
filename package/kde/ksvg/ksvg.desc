[I] A library for rendering SVG stylesheet re-coloring and on-disk caching

[T] KSvg provides both C++ classes and QtQuick components to render svgs
[T] based on image packs. Compared to plain QSvg, it caches the rendered
[T] images on disk with KImageCache, and can re-color properly crafted svg
[T] shapes that include internal stylesheets.
