[I] A tool for interactive eye-candy on your KDE desktop

[T] Theme writers create themes, or text files that define their widget.
[T] Then, they can optionally add python scripting to make their widget
[T] interactive. The possibilities are endless! 
[T]
[T] Here are just some examples of the things that can be done: 
[T] - Display system information such as CPU Usage, MP3 playing, etc.
[T] - Create cool custom toolbars that work any way imaginable
[T] - Create little games or virtual pets that live on your desktop
[T] - Display information from the internet, such as weather and headlines
