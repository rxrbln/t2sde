[I] KDE media player

[T] Kaffeine is a media player. What makes it different from the others is its
[T] excellent support of digital TV (DVB). Kaffeine has user-friendly
[T] interface, so that even first time users can start immediately playing
[T] their movies: from DVD (including DVD menus, titles, chapters, etc.), VCD,
[T] or a file.
