[I] A barcode and label printing application

[T] KBarcode is a barcode and label printing application for KDE. It can be used
[T] to print every thing from simple business cards up to complex labels with
[T] several barcodes (e.g. article descriptions).

[T] KBarcode comes with an easy to use WYSIWYG label designer, batch import
[T] of labels (directly from the delivery note), thousands of predefined
