[I] KDE4 Media Framework

[T] Phonon is the multimedia API for KDE 4. Phonon was created to allow
[T] KDE 4 to be independent of any single multimedia framework such as
[T] GStreamer or Xine and to provide a stable API for KDE 4's lifetime.
[T] It was done to fix problems of frameworks becoming unmaintained, API
[T] instability, and to create a simple multimedia API.
