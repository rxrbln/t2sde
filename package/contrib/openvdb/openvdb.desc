[I] Sparse volume data structure and tools

[T] OpenVDB is an open source C++ library comprising a novel hierarchical
[T] data structure and a large suite of tools for the efficient storage
[T] and manipulation of sparse volumetric data discretized on
[T] three-dimensional grids. It was developed by DreamWorks Animation for
[T] use in volumetric applications typically encountered in feature film
[T] production.
