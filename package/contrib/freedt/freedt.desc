[I] Reimplementation of Dan Bernstein's daemontools

[T] freedt is a reimplementation of Dan Bernstein's daemontools under
[T] the GNU GPL, sharing no code with the original implementation.
[T] It currently includes feature-equivalent replacements for argv0,
[T] envdir, envuidgid, setlock, setuidgid, softlimit, supervise, svc,
[T] svok, svscan, svstat and recordio. It also includes dumblog (a
[T] simple multilog replacement), mkservice (a script for automatically
[T] creating service directories), anonidentd (an anonimising identd
[T] implementation) and ratelimit (a bandwidth-limiting filter along
[T] the lines of recordio). All the tools include usage messages; for
[T] instance, do "ratelimit -h" for a brief rundown of the options
