[I] Round Robin Database and graph generation

[T] RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store
[T] and display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room
[T] temperature, server load average). It stores the data in a very compact
[T] way that will not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by
[T] processing the data to enforce a certain data density. It can be used
[T] either via simple wrapper scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends
[T] that poll network devices and put a friendly user interface on it.
