[I] Tools for creating and displaying DjVu files

[T] DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform for
[T] distributing documents and images. DjVu can advantageously replace
[T] PDF, PS, TIFF, JPEG, and GIF for distributing scanned documents,
[T] digital documents, or high-resolution pictures. DjVu content downloads
[T] faster, displays and renders faster, looks nicer on a screen, and
[T] consume less client resources than competing formats. DjVu images
[T] display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed and panned with no
[T] lengthy re-rendering. DjVu is used by hundreds of academic,
[T] commercial, governmental, and non-commercial web sites around the
[T] world.
[T] 
[T] DjVuLibre is an open source (GPL'ed) implementation of DjVu,
[T] including viewers, browser plugins, decoders, simple encoders, and
[T] utilities.
