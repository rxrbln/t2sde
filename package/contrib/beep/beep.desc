[I] A console beep tool with precision control

[T] Beep allows the user to control the pc-speaker with precision, allowing
[T] different sounds to indicate different events. While it can be run quite
[T] happily on the command line, it's intended place of residence is within
[T] shell/perl scripts, notifying the user when something interesting occurs.
[T] Of course, it has no notion of what's interesting, but it's real good
[T] at that notifying part.
