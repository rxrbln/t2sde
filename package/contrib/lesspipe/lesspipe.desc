[I] A preprocessor for less

[T] lesspipe.sh is an input filter for the pager less as described in less's
[T] man page. The script runs under a ksh-compatible shell (ksh, bash, zsh)
[T] and allows you to use less to view compressed files, archives, and files
[T] contained in archives. Viewing files by accessing a device file is
[T] implemented to some extent (DOS filesystems and tar files). It supports
[T] the following formats (both as plain and compressed files using
[T] compress, gzip, bzip2, or zip): tar, nroff, (sh)ar, HTML, executables,
[T] directories, RPM and Debian (.deb) archives, MS-Word, ps, DVI, and PDF.
