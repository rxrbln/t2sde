[I] Virtualization tool designed to test complex network simulation scenarios 

[T] VNUML (Virtual Network User Mode Linux) is an open-source general purpose 
[T] virtualization tool designed to quickly define and test complex network 
[T] simulation scenarios based on the great User Mode Linux (UML) virtualization 
[T] software.  
[T] VNUML is aimed to help in testing network applications and services over 
[T] complex testbeds made of several nodes (even tenths) and networks inside one 
[T] Linux machine, without involving the investment and management complexity 
[T] needed to create them using real equipment.
