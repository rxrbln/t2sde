[I] A text-mode window manager and terminal emulator

[T] Twin is a text-mode window environment. It turns a text terminal into
[T] a X11-style display with window manager, terminal windows, and can also
[T] serve as display for remote applications. Each terminal window provides
[T] the functions of a text-mode Linux console. Twin runs on X11, libggi,
[T] itself, the Linux console, and any termcap/ncurses-compatible tty. It
[T] supports multiple simultaneous displays, and can attach/detach each
[T] display on the fly.
