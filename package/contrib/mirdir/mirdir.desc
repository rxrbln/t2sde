[I] Compare two directory trees, copy differences

[T] Mirdir allows to synchronize two directory trees in a fast way. Only the
[T] differences between the two sets of files are copied while the excess
[T] files/directories in the destination tree are removed (unless there was
[T] an explicit request to keep them).
