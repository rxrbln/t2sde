[I] Award-winning software for efficient LiDAR compression

[T] Open-source compression library for compressing LAS to LAZ. LASzip is
[T] completely lossless: It compresses bulky LAS files into compact LAZ files
[T] that are only 7-20% of the original size, while accurately preserving every
[T] single bit. Likewise, LAZ files can be decompressed into a bitwise
[T] identical LAS file. LASzip allows compressed LAZ files to be treated like
[T] standard LAS files. They can be loaded directly from the compressed form
[T] into an application without first decompressing them to a disk.
