[I] Monitor resolution probe

[T] xresprobe is a package that probes both laptop and DDC-compliant screens
[T] for their standard resolutions, and returns a specifically-formatted,
[T] easy-to-parse output.
[T] It contains the 'ddcprobe' utility, which performs a DDC probe to the
[T] monitor; however, ddcprobe only works on i386 and powerpc. The laptop
[T] detection routines are, however, sufficiently generic to be useful to
[T] other architectures.
