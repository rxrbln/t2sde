[I] Direct Framebuffer fusion kernel module

[T] DirectFB is a thin library that provides hardware graphics
[T] acceleration, input device handling and abstraction, integrated
[T] windowing system with support for translucent windows and multiple
[T] display layers on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device. It is a
[T] complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for
[T] every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying
[T] hardware. DirectFB adds graphical power to embedded systems and
[T] sets a new standard for graphics under Linux. more...
