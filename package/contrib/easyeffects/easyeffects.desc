[I] Simple audio effects

[T] This application was formerly known as PulseEffects, but it was renamed to
[T] Easy Effects after it started to use GTK4 and GStreamer usage was replaced
[T] by native PipeWire filters. And eventually the whole application was ported
[T] from GTK4 to a combination of Qt, QML and KDE/Kirigami frameworks.
