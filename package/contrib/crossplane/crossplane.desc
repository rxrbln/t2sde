[I] The Cloud Native Control Plane

[T] Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
[T] needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you
[T] to build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and
[T] infrastructure no matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend
[T] that puts you in control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.
