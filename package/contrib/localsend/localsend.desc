[I] An open-source cross-platform alternative to AirDrop

[T] LocalSend is a free, open-source app that allows you to securely
[T] share files and messages with nearby devices over your local network
[T] without needing an internet connection. Unlike other apps, LocalSend
[T] does not require an external server or internet access. It uses a
[T] secure REST API over HTTPS for local device communication. Built
[T] with Flutter and Rust, it runs natively on Linux, macOS, Windows,
[T] Android and iOS.
