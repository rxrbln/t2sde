[I] View disk space usage and delete unwanted data, fast

[T] dua (Disk Usage Analyzer) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage
[T] of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max
[T] out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible.
[T] Optionally delete superfluous data, and do so more quickly than rm.
