[I] Intel Implicit SPMD Program Compiler

[T] Ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language, with
[T] extensions for single program, multiple data programming. Under the SPMD
[T] model, the programmer writes a program that generally appears to be a
[T] regular serial program, though the execution model is actually that a
[T] number of program instances execute in parallel on the hardware.
