[I] Read and parse monitor EDID

[T] read-edid is a pair of tools (originally by John Fremlin) for reading the
[T] EDID from a monitor. It should work with most monitors made since 1996,
[T] assuming the video card supports the standard read commands (most do).
[T] read-edid is a set of two tools - get-edid, which gets the raw edid
[T] information from the monitor, and parse-edid, which turns the raw binary
[T] information into a xorg.conf-compatible monitor section (Modelines also
[T] compatible with xrandr).
