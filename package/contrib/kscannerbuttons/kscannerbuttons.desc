[I] A monitor which responds to scanner button presses

[T] KScannerButtons is a daemon plus an optional KDE frontend for monitoring
[T] your scanner buttons so that actions can be taken in response to button
[T] presses. It's composed of a daemon (sanebuttond), a frontend that will
[T] display an icon in the systray, and a dialog box to configure and launch
[T] the daemon. It is based on the button monitoring capabilities found in
[T] some SANE backends. It has been tested with the avision backend and an
[T] HP 5300C scanner. The frontend requires Kommander (kde-webdev).
