# Raku toolchain doesn't use autotools, therefore the configure stage has to
# be modified to support its Configure.pl script

# Note: The libraries specified in confopt are required for building MoarVM; if
# they are not present, MoarVM will build and statically link them to itself,
# in some cases alongside installing their headers globally, which is not good.
#
# (libsha1 is excluded, because it doesn't have a T2 package.)
