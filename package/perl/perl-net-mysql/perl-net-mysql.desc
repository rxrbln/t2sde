[I] Pure Perl MySQL network protocol interface

[T] Net::MySQL is a Pure Perl client interface for the MySQL database. This
[T] module implements network protocol between server and client of MySQL,
[T] thus you don't need external MySQL client library like libmysqlclient
[T] for this module to work. It means this module enables you to connect to
[T] MySQL server from some operation systems which MySQL is not ported.
