[I] Perl library to make client connections to a TCP ports

[T] Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port
[T] and do network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET
[T] protocol.  Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are
[T] provided.  More sophisticated interactive features are provided
[T] because connecting to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating
[T] with a program designed for human interaction.  These interactive
[T] features include the ability to specify a timeout and to wait for
[T] patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a
[T] shell.
