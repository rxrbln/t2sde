[T] implements the URI class.  Objects of this class represent Uniform
[T] Resource Identifier (URI) references as specified in RFC 2396.

[T] URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various components
[T] that make up these strings.  There are also methods to combine URIs in
[T] various ways.
