[I] Perl module Template-Toolkit

[T] The Template Toolkit is a collection of modules which implement a
[T] fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system.
[T] It was originally designed and remains primarily useful for generating
[T] dynamic web content, but it can be used equally well for processing
[T] any other kind of text based documents: HTML, XML, POD, PostScript,
[T] LaTeX, and so on.
