[I] Perl module for simple terminal control

[T] Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple
[T] control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support
[T] for non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized
[T] handy functions for working with terminals.
