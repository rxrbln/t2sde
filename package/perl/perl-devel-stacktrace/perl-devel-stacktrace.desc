[I] Perl module - Stack trace and stack trace frame objects

[T] The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace
[T] and Devel::StackTraceFrame. The goal of this object is to encapsulate
[T] the information that can found through using the caller() function,
[T] as well as providing a simple interface to this data.
