[I] Perl module - Stack trace and stack trace frame objects 

[T] The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace 
[T] and Devel::StackTraceFrame. The goal of this object is to encapsulate 
[T] the information that can found through using the caller() function, 
[T] as well as providing a simple interface to this data.
