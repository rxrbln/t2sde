[T] from C, sed, awk, shell scripting (sh), and (to a lesser extent) from many
[T] other programming languages.
[T]
[T] Perl was designed to be a practical language to extract information from
[T] text files and to generate reports from that information - the Swiss Army
[T] Chainsaw of Programming Languages.
