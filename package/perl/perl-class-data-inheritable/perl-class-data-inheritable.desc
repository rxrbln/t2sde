[I] Perl module - Inheritable, overridable class data

[T] Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class
[T] data. That is, if you want to store something about your class as a
[T] whole (instead of about a single object). This data is then inherited by
[T] your subclasses and can be overriden.
