[I] A super-simplistic front-end to pkg-config for Makefile.PLs 

[T] The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries, 
[T] usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them. 
[T] ExtUtils::PkgConfig is a very simplistic interface to this utility, 
[T] intended for use in the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind 
[T] libraries that pkg-config knows. It is really just boilerplate code that 
[T] you would've written yourself.
