[I] Perl module Text-Autoformat

[T] Autoformat provides intelligent formatting of plaintext without the need
[T] for any kind of embedded mark-up. The module recognizes Internet quoting
[T] conventions, a wide range of bulleting and number schemes, centred text,
[T] and block quotations, and reformats each appropriately
