[I] Provide framework for multiple event loops

[T] AnyEvent provides an identical interface to multiple event loops. This
[T] allows module authors to utilizy an event loop without forcing module
[T] users to use the same event loop (as only a single event loop can
[T] coexist peacefully at any one time).
