[T] Mhash is a free library which provides a uniform interface to a large 
[T] number of hash algorithms. These algorithms can be used to compute check-
[T] sums, message digests, and other signatures. The HMAC support implements 
[T] the basics for message authentication, following RFC 2104. In the later 
[T] versions some key generation algorithms, which use hash algorithms, have 
[T] been added. At the time of writing this, the library supports the 
[T] algorithms: SHA1, GOST, HAVAL256, HAVAL224, HAVAL192, HAVAL160, HAVAL128,
[T] MD5, MD4, RIPEMD160, TIGER, TIGER160, TIGER128, CRC32B and CRC32 checksums.
