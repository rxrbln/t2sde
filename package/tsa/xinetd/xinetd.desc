[I] xinetd

[T] xinetd is a replacement for inetd, the internet services daemon. 
[T] Anybody can use it to start servers that don't require privileged
[T] ports because xinetd does not require that the services in its   
[T] configuration file be listed in /etc/services. It can do access  
[T] control on all services based on the address of the remote host  
[T] and time of access. Access control works on all services, whether
[T] multi-threaded or single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP
[T] protocols.
