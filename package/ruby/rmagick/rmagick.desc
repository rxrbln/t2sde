[I] An interface to the ImageMagick image processing libraries

[T] RMagick is a complete interface to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick. Within
[T] its four major classes and 30 minor classes RMagick defines over 600 
[T] methods and 225 constants. RMagick exploits Ruby idioms such as blocks and
[T] iterators, Struct classes, symbols, ?- and !-suffixed methods, and 
[T] exceptions.
