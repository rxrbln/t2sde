[I] A library providing weak aliases for pthread functions

[T] This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided in
[T] libc or otherwise available by default. Libraries like libxcb rely on
[T] pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when linked
[T] to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
[T] single-threaded.
