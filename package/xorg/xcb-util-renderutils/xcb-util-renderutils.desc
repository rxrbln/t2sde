[I] A number of libxcb renderutils

[T] The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of
[T] libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
[T] libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
[T] and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
[T] libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
[T] the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.
