[I] Locale and ISO 2022 support for Unicode terminals

[T] Luit is a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
[T] UTF-8 terminal emulator. It will convert application output from the
[T] locale's encoding into UTF-8, and convert terminal input from UTF-8
[T] into the locale's encoding.
