On at least powerpc64 long is 64bit, and since XID, used for Window and Pixmap
are 64bit then some protocol fields are not properly defined.

I tried serveral attempts to fix this bug, including fixing the main X headers
however it turned out it all has too many sideeffects. See X.org bug #1425 for
a complete trace with additional comments.

On x86-64 libXcomposite only works accidently due the endianess differnce, the
structure is miss-sized there as well.
