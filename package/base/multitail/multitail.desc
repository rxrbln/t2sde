[I] Lets you view several files at once in a window, with colors

[T] MultiTail lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail
[T] program. The difference is that it creates multiple windows on your
[T] console (with ncurses). Merging of 2 or more log files is possible. It
[T] can also use colors while displaying the log files (through regular
[T] expressions) for faster recognition of what is important. It can also
[T] filter lines (again with regular expressions). It has interactive
[T] menus for editing given regular expressions and deleting and adding
[T] windows. One can also have windows with the output of shell scripts and
[T] other software. When viewing the output of external software, MultiTail
[T] can mimic the functionality of tools like 'watch'.
