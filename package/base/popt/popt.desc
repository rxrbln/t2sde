[I] A command-line option parsing library

[T] This is the popt command line option parsing library. While it is similiar
[T] to getopt(3), it contains a number of enhancements, including:
[T] 
[T]         1) popt is fully reentrant
[T]         2) popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays while 
[T]            getopt(2) makes this quite difficult
[T]         3) popt allows users to alias command line arguments
[T]         4) popt provides convience functions for parsting strings
[T]            into argv[] style arrays
[T] 
[T] popt is used by rpm, the Red Hat install program, and many other Red Hat
[T] utilities, all of which provide excellent examples of how to use popt.
