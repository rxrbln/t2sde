[I] Detection and protection against stack smashing attacks

[T] The libsafe library protects a process against the exploitation of
[T] buffer overflow vulnerabilities in process stacks.  Libsafe works with
[T] any existing pre-compiled executable and can be used transparently,
[T] even on a system-wide basis.  The method intercepts all calls to
[T] library functions that are known to be vulnerable.  A substitute
[T] version of the corresponding function implements the original
[T] functionality, but in a manner that ensures that any buffer overflows
[T] are contained within the current stack frame.  Libsafe has been shown
[T] to detect several known attacks and can potentially prevent yet
[T] unknown attacks.  Experiments indicate that the performance overhead
[T] of libsafe is negligible.
