[I] Procinfo, lsdev and socklist

[T] Procinfo is a small program that gathers some system information from
[T] diverse files under /proc and prints it to the screen. It duplicates some of
[T] the functionality of free(1) and uptime(1). It should work with any kernel
[T] release close to 1.0 or later up to the latest development kernel. (Well, I
[T] haven't actually tried 1.0 for years, but you get the idea.)
[T] 
[T] Lsdev is a Perl script that attempts to tabulate DMA, IRQ and I/O port
[T] allocation per kernel driver.
[T] 
[T] Socklist is a Perl script that gives you a list of all open sockets,
[T] enumerating types, port, inode, uid, pid, fd and the program to which
[T] it belongs. Contributed by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@jlab.org>.
