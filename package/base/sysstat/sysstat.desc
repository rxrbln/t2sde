[I] The sar and iostat commands for Linux

[T] The sysstat package contains the sar, mpstat, and iostat commands for
[T] Linux. The sar command collects and reports system activity information.
[T] This information can also be saved in a system activity file for future
[T] inspection. The iostat command reports CPU statistics and I/O statistics
[T] for tty devices and disks. The statistics reported by sar concern I/O
[T] transfer rates, paging activity, process-related activites, interrupts,
[T] network activity, memory and swap space utilization, CPU utilization,
[T] kernel activities, and TTY statistics, among others. Both UP and SMP
[T] machines are fully supported.
