[I] A C++ standard library focused on space

[T] uClibc++ is a C++ standard library targeted towards the embedded
[T] systems/software market. As such it may purposefully lack features
[T] which you might normally expect to find in a full fledged C++
[T] standard library. The library will focus on space savings as opposed
[T] to performance.
