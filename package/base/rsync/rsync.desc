[I] rsync is a replacement for rcp that has many more features.

[T] rsync uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for
[T] bringing remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the
[T] differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
[T] sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.
[T] At first glance this may seem impossible because the calculation of
[T] diffs between two files normally requires local access to both
[T] files.
