[I] The GNU Bourne Again shell (bash)

[T] Bash is a Unix command interpreter (shell).  It is an implementation of
[T] the Posix 1003.2 shell standard, and resembles the Korn and System V
[T] shells.
[T] 
[T] Bash contains a number of enhancements over those shells, both
[T] for interactive use and shell programming.  Features geared
[T] toward interactive use include command line editing, command
[T] history, job control, aliases, and prompt expansion.  Programming
[T] features include additional variable expansions, shell
[T] arithmetic, and a number of variables and options to control
[T] shell behavior.
