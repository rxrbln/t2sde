[I] The procmail mail processing program.

[T] Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming mail
[T] into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to one or more
[T] mailing lists or for prioritising your mail), preprocess your mail, start
[T] any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate different chimes on your
[T] workstation for different types of mail) or selectively forward certain
[T] incoming mail automatically to someone.
[T] 
[T] Procmail can be used:
[T]         - and installed by an unprivileged user (for himself only).
[T]         - as a drop in replacement for the local delivery agent /bin/mail
[T]           (with biff/comsat support).
[T]         - as a general mailfilter for whole groups of messages (e.g. when
[T]           called from within sendmail.cf rules).
[T] 
[T] The accompanying formail program enables you to generate autoreplies, split
[T] up digests/mailboxes into the original messages, do some very simple
[T] header-munging/extraction, or force mail into mail-format (with leading From
[T] line).
