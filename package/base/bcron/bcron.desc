[I] a new cron system designed with secure operations in mind

[T] This is bcron, a new cron system designed with secure operations in
[T] mind.  To do this, the system is divided into several seperate programs,
[T] each responsible for a seperate task, with strictly controlled
[T] communications between them.  The user interface is a drop-in
[T] replacement for similar systems (such as vixie-cron), but the internals
[T] differ greatly.
