[I] The GNU general-purpose parser generator

[T] "Bison" is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a
[T] grammar description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C
[T] program to parse that grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you
[T] may use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used
[T] in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.
[T] 
[T] Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc
[T] grammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone familiar with
[T] Yacc should be able to use Bison with little trouble.  You need to be
[T] fluent in C programming in order to use Bison or to understand this
[T] manual.
