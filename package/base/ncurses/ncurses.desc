[I] The ncurses (new curses) library

[T] The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of
[T] curses in System V Release 4.0, and more. It uses terminfo format,
[T] supports pads and color and multiple highlights and forms characters
[T] and function-key mapping, and has all the other SYSV-curses
[T] enhancements over BSD curses.
