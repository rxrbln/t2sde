[I] Linux scheduler utilities

[T] The Linux scheduler utilities take advantage of the scheduler family of
[T] syscalls that Linux implements across various kernels. These system calls
[T] implement interfaces for scheduler-related parameters such as CPU affinity
[T] and real-time attributes. The standard UNIX utilities do not provide
[T] support for these interfaces, thus this package. The programs that are
[T] included in this package are chrt and taskset. Together with nice and
[T] renice (not included), they allow full control of process scheduling
[T] parameters. The taskset program allows manipulation of task CPU affinity
[T] and the chrt program allows manipulation of scheduling priority and policy.
