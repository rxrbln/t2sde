[I] Utilities to manage/change user passwd information

[T] pwdutils is a collection of utilities to manage the passwd and
[T] shadow user information. The difference to the shadow suite
[T] is that these utilities can also modify the information stored
[T] in NIS, NIS+, or LDAP. PAM is used for user authentication
[T] and changing the pasword. It contains passwd, chage, chfn,
[T] chsh, chpasswd, expiry, gpasswd, grpck, groupadd, groupdel,
[T] groupmod, grpunconv, newgrp, pwck, pwconv, pwunconv, useradd,
[T] userdel, usermod, vipw, and a daemon for changing the password on
[T] a remote machine over a secure SSL connection. The daemon also uses
[T] PAM, so it can change passwords no matter where they are stored.
