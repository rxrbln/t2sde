When the old demangler is build, the new directory is entered and a
cd ../libiberty & make old_demagler (or so) should be build.
But libiberty is not build at this point. I first tried to just move
@all_build_modules@ at the end. But this does not work, because for
some strange reason the new demangler is build inside the $arch
directory (as in cross-builds) and the rest not ... So for now
disabled ... (this seems to be a stage-1 build only problem - only
at this stage binutils is build without the new demangler natively)
