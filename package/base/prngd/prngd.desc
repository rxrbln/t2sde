[I] A daemon designed to act as an entropy source

[T] The Pseudo Random Number Generator Daemon (PRNGD) offers an EGD
[T] compatible interface for obtaining random data. It is intented to
[T] be used as an entropy source to feed other software, especially
[T] software based on OpenSSL. Like EGD, it calls system programs
[T] to collect entropy. Unlike EGD, it does not generate a pool
[T] of random bits that can be called from other software. Instead, it
[T] feeds the bits gathered into the OpenSSL PRNG, from which the
[T] "random bits" are obtained when requested. This way, PRNGD is
[T] never drained and can never block (unlike EGD),
[T] so it is also suitable to seed inetd-started programs. It also
[T] features a seed-save file, so that it is immediately usable after
[T] system start.
