[I] The Embedded GNU C library 32bit compatbility version for 64bit systems

[T] The Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) is a variant of the GNU C Library (GLIBC)
[T] that is designed to work well on embedded systems. EGLIBC strives to be
[T] source and binary compatible with GLIBC. EGLIBC's goals include reduced
[T] footprint, configurable components, better support for cross-compilation
[T] and cross-testing.
[T]
[T] In contrast to what Ulrich Drepper makes out of GLIBC, in EGLIBC all
[T] patches assigned to the FSF will be considered regardless of individual
[T] or company affiliation and cooperation is encouraged, as well as
[T] communication, civility, and respect among developers.
