[I] Mount removable devices as normal user

[T] Pmount is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits normal
[T] users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry. This
[T] provides a robust basis for automounting frameworks and confines the
[T] amount of code that runs as root to a minimum.
