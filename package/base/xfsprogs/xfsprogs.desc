[I] XFS filesystem utilities

[T] XFS is a journalling filesystem developed by SGI and used in
[T] SGI's IRIX operating system. It is now also available under GPL for
[T] linux. It is extremely scalable, using btrees extensively to support
[T] large and/or sparse files, and extremely large directories. The
[T] journalling capability means no more waiting for fsck's or worrying
[T] about meta-data corruption.
[T] 
[T] This package contains the utilities needed for using XFS.
