[I] Tools for the Xen hypervisor

[T] Xen is an open-source virtual machine monitor, or hypervisor, developed
[T] by the University of Cambridge. Xen provides secure isolation, resource
[T] control, quality-of-service guarantees, and live migration of virtual
[T] machines. Operating systems must be explicitly modified to run on Xen -
[T] this enables Xen to achieve high-performance virtualization.
