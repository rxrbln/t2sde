# This file will be started at the very beginning of /etc/rc.d/init.d/system
# and should be used to load kernel modules, to configure the kernel and to
# set up the hardware.
#

# setpci <options>
# modprobe <some_driver>
# echo <value(s)> > /proc/sys/<some_file>

# If you do own an IDE cd-writer, pass somthing like 'hdc=ide-scsi' as kernel
# boot parameter and load the ide-scsi module. This will allow you to access
# the IDE cd-writer as generic scsi device (and scsi cd-rom).
#
# modprobe ide-scsi

# The mkinitrd script is reading this file to get the list of modules for the
# initrd image. It automatically skips those files with a 'no-initrd' comment:
#
# modprobe some-module-here # no-initrd
