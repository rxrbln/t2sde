ROCKCFG_SYSFILE_ANSI_ISSUE
  With this option you can select which issue is to be displayed in the
  installed ROCKLinux system. Issue is being displayed in before the login
  prompt on text virtual consoles 2 to 6.

ROCKCFG_SYSFILE_SHOW_ANSI_ISSUE
  Here you can preview the issue. Remember that if you are running
  ./scripts/Config in xterm the issue will probably look pretty crappy. If you
  really want to preview it correctly you should run ./scripts/Config in the
  plain text linux console. Then it might look correctly ;-)
