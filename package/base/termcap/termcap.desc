[I] Terminal capability database

[T] This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that
[T] enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way
[T] independent of the terminal type.  The GNU termcap library does not
[T] place an arbitrary limit on the size of termcap entries, unlike most
[T] other termcap libraries.
