[I] A hardware-independent library for executing real-mode x86 code

[T] It's often useful to be able to make real-mode x86 BIOS calls from
[T] userland. libx86 is built on top of two bodies of code - lrmi and
[T] x86emu. x86emu is a generic x86 emulator.
[T]
[T] On x86 platforms, libx86 will use the vm86 interface provided by
[T] most modern kernels in order to execute code. On non-x86 platforms,
[T] an interface layer is provided to allow x86emu to be used to execute
[T] lrmi function calls.
