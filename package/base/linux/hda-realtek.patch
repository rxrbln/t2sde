The Surface Pro 2 and 3 have a strage frequency response and miss most of the
bass. I discovered connecting the HP out to the main DAC fixes this.
Maybe the other is mono or whatever strangely mixed signal?

As the Lenovo Ideapad 720S (AMD) and possibly the Dell XPS13 are also affected,
this may be a general bug w/ most Realtek codecs and the hda_auto_parser, ...
