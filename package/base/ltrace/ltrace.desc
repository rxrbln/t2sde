[I] library call tracer

[T] ltrace is a library call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
[T] a trace of all the dynamic library calls made by another process/program.
[T] 
[T] It also displays system calls, as well as 'strace', but strace still
[T] does a better job displaying arguments to system calls.
[T] 
[T] The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
[T] use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.
