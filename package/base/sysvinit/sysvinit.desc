[I] This is the Linux System V init

[T] The SysVinit package contains a group of processes that
[T] control the very basic functions of your system. SysVinit includes
[T] the init program, the first program started by the Linux
[T] kernel when the system boots. Init then controls the startup,
[T] running and shutdown of all other programs.
