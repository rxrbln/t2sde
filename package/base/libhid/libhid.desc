[I] A user-space USB HID access library written in C

[T] libhid provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact with
[T] USB HID devices, much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is
[T] based on libusb 0.1,thus it requires no special HID support in the
[T] kernel. Furthermore, it aims to support all operating system supported
[T] by libusb: Linux, BSD, OS X, and Windows (via libusb-win32).
