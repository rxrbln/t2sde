[I] A library for getting and setting POSIX.1e capabilities

[T] As of Linux 2.2.0, the power of the superuser has been partitioned
[T] into a set of discrete capabilities (in other places, these
[T] capabilities are know as privileges).
[T]
[T] The contents of the libcap package are a library and a number of
[T] simple programs that are intended to show how an application/daemon
[T] can be protected (with wrappers) or rewritten to take advantage of
[T] this fine grained approach to constraining the danger to your system
[T] from programs running as 'root'.
