[I] An UNIX init scheme with service supervision

[T] runit is a daemontools alike replacement for SysV-init and other init
[T] schemes. It currently runs on GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and can easily
[T] be adapted to other Unix operating systems. runit implements a simple
[T] three-stage concept. Stage 1 performs the system's one-time initialization
[T] tasks. Stage 2 starts the system's uptime services (via the runsvdir
[T] program). Stage 3 handles the tasks necessary to shutdown and halt or
[T] reboot.
