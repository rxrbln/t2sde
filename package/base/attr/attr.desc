[I] Extended Attributes Of Filesystem Objects

[T] Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated perma-
[T] nently with files and directories, similar to the environ-
[T] ment  strings associated with a process.  An attribute may
[T] be defined or undefined.  If it is defined, its value  may
[T] be empty or non-empty.

[T] Extended   attributes   are   extensions   to  the  normal
[T] attributes which are associated with  all  inodes  in  the
[T] system  (i.e.  the  stat(2) data).  They are often used to
[T] provide additional functionality to  a  filesystem  -  for
[T] example,  additional security features such as Access Con-
[T] trol  Lists  (ACLs)  may  be  implemented  using  extended
[T] attributes.
