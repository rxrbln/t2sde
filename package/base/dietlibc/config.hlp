ROCKCFG_DIETLIBC
  If you select this option you will be able to select to compile some

  your build will more likely fail.

ROCKCFG_DIETLIBC_DYN
  This option controls whether to link binaries dynamically with the
  dietlibc. Normally you link programs statically with dietlibc. The
  dynamic linker of dietlibc is only a proof of concept and not a stable
  program! And so enabling this options will most likely fail to compile
