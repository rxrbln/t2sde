We build dietlibc with WANT_DYNAMIC so we get ctor/dtor handling, even
for static programs, as normally needed.

The patch zeros register 6 passed for dl_init to _dyn_start since otherwise
we end up in an inf. loop calling the _dyn_start (where r6 points to) again
and again ... This is NOT intended for upstream merge - just a quick hack
to get it working.
