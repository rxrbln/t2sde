[I] System and kernel logging services

[T] socklog, in cooperation with the runit package, is a small and secure
[T] replacement for syslogd. There are three main features syslogd provides:
[T] - receiving syslog messages from an unix domain socket ("/dev/log") and
[T] writing them to various files on disk depending on facility and priority.
[T] - receiving syslog messages from an udp socket ("0.0.0.0:514") and writing
[T] them to various files on disk depending on facility and priority.
[T] - writing received syslog messages to an udp socket ("a.b.c.d:514")
[T]
[T] socklog provides the first two features with the help of runit's runsvdir,
[T] runsv, and svlogd, provides a different network logging concept, and
[T] additionally does log event notification.
[T]
[T] svlogd has a built in log file rotation based on file size, so there is no
[T] need for any cron jobs or similar to rotate the logs. Log partitions can be
[T] calculated properly.
