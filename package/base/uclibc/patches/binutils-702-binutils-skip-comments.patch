localealias.s:544: Error: junk at end of line, first unrecognized character is `,' 
when building glibc-2.3.2 with gcc-3.4.0 and binutils-2.15.90.0.3

Paths adjusted to match crosstool's patcher.

This means that the unknown character is no longer ignored, despite the
comment.  As a side effect a line starting with a line comment character
not followed by APP in NO_APP mode now triggers an error instead of just a
warning, breaking builds of glibc on m68k-linux.  Earlier in
read_a_source_file where #APP is handled there is another comment that
claims that unknown comments are ignored, when in fact they aren't (only
the initial line comment character is skipped).

Note that the presence of #APP will mess up the line counters, but
that appears to be difficult to fix.

Andreas.

	* read.c (read_a_source_file): Ignore unknown text after line
	comment character.  Fix misleading comment.
