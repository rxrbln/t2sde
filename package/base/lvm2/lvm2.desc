[I] Logical Volume Management (Version 2)

[T] LVM includes all of the support for handling read/write operations on
[T] physical volumes (hard disks, RAID-Systems, magneto optical, etc.,
[T] multiple devices (MD), see mdadd(8) or even loop devices, see losetup(8)),
[T] creating volume groups (kind of virtual disks) from one or more physical
[T] volumes and creating one or more logical volumes (kind of logical
[T] partitions) in volume groups.
[T] This 2nd version is based on device-mapper available in linux-2.6.
