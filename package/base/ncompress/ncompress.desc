[I] Ncompress (an improved version of compress 4.1).

[T] Compress is a fast, simple LZW file compressor.  Compress does not have
[T] the highest compression rate, but it is one of the fastest programs to
[T] compress data.  Compress is the defacto standard in the UNIX community
[T] for compressing files.
