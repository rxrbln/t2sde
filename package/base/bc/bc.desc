[I] GNU's bc (a numeric processing language) and dc (a calculator)

[T] bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language.  Syntax is
[T] similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas.  It supports
[T] interactive execution of statements.  bc is a utility included in the
[T] POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.
[T] Since the POSIX document does not specify how bc must be implemented, 
[T] this version does not use the historical method of having bc be 
[T] a compiler for the dc calculator. This version has a single 
[T] executable that both compiles the language and runs the resulting 
[T] `byte code'. The byte code is not the dc language.
