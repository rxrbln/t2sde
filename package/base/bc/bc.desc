[I] GNU's numeric processing language and a calculator

[T] Bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language. Syntax is
[T] similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas. It supports
[T] interactive execution of statements. Bc is a utility included in the
[T] POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.
[T] Since the POSIX document does not specify how bc must be implemented,
[T] this version does not use the historical method of having bc be
[T] a compiler for the dc calculator. This version has a single
[T] executable that both compiles the language and runs the resulting
[T] `byte code'. The byte code is not the dc language.
