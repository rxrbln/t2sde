[I] Mouse Emulation Daemon

[T] This mouse button emulation tool lets you: emulate middle and right click,
[T] a mouse wheel and block the trackpad while typing. It is most often used
[T] on Apple laptops but can also be handy on other models.
[T]
[T] In contrast to the in-kernel mac_hid hack which only implements button
[T] emulation, the toool operates entierly in user-space and therefore
[T] needs a 2.6 kernel with userspace input event interface (uinput) compiled
[T] in or as module.
