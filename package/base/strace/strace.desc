[I] trace system calls and signals

[T] In the simplest case strace  runs  the  specified  command
[T] until  it  exits.   It  intercepts  and records the system
[T] calls which are called by a process and the signals  which
[T] are  received by a process.  The name of each system call,
[T] its arguments and its return value are printed on standard
[T] error or to the file specified with the -o option.
