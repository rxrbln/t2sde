[I] An enhanced syslog daemon

[T] Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd. Among other features,
[T] it offers support for reliable syslog over TCP and RFC 3195, writing
[T] to MySQL databases, fully configurable output formats (including great
[T] timestamps), the ability to filter on any part of the syslog message, and
[T] on-the-wire message compression. It is designed as a drop-in replacement
[T] for stock syslogd and thus is able to work with the same configuration
[T] file syntax. Of course, some enhanced features require changing the
[T] configuration file, but in general, this should be fairly easy.
