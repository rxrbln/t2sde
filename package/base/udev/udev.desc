[I] A Userspace Implementation of devfs

[T] udev is a program that replaces the functionality of devfs (only providing
[T] /dev entries for devices that are in the system at any moment in time), and
[T] allows for features that were previously not able to be done through devfs
[T] alone, such as:
[T]  Persistent naming for devices when they move around the device tree.
[T]  Notification of external systems of device changes.
[T]  A flexible device naming scheme.
[T]  Allow the kernel to use dynamic major and minor numbers
[T]  Move all naming policy out of the kernel.
