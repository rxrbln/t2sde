[I] The Linux Ext2 filesystem dump/restore utilities

[T] The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines 
[T] files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up,
[T] and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage
[T] medium. The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; 
[T] it can restore a full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental 
[T] backups can then be layered on top of the full backup. Single files
[T] and directory subtrees may also be restored from full or partial backups.
