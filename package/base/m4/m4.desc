[I] The m4 macro processor

[T] GNU 'M4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
[T] processor. It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
[T] extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters
[T] to macros). 'M4' also has built-in functions for including files,
[T] running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc. Autoconf needs GNU
[T] 'M4' for generating 'configure' scripts, but not for running them.
