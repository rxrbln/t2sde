[I] A monitor for system resources and process activity

[T] Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor, similar to the top
[T] command. At regular intervals, it shows system-level activity related to
[T] the CPU, memory, swap, disks and network layers, and it shows for every
[T] active process the CPU utilization in system and user mode, the virtual
[T] and resident memory growth, priority, username, state, and exit code. The
[T] process level activity is also shown for processes which finished during
[T] the last interval, to get a complete overview about the consumers of
[T] things such as CPU time. Atop only shows the active system-resources
[T] and processes, and only shows the deviations since the previous interval.
