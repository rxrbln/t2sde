# If an application is running automake, it includes all the stuff
# from usr/share/aclocal/ and so depends on all packages placing
# something there.
#
# We can savely ignore those dependencies, since a package which is really
# using an others package aclocal file will also access other files related
# to the package outside of usr/share/aclocal.
