[I] A GNU tool for automatically creating Makefiles

[T] This is Automake, a Makefile generator.  It was inspired by the 4.4BSD
[T] make and include files, but aims to be portable and to conform to the
[T] GNU standards for Makefile variables and targets.
[T] 
[T] Automake is a Perl script.  The input files are called Makefile.am.
[T] The output files are called Makefile.in; they are intended for use
[T] with Autoconf.  Automake requires certain things to be done in your
[T] configure.in.
