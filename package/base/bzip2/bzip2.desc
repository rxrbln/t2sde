[I] A file compression utility

[T] bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler blocksorting text
[T] compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
[T] considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based
[T] compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of
[T] statistical compressors.
