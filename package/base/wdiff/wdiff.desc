[I] The 'word diff'

[T] 'wdiff' is a front-end to GNU 'diff'.  It compares two files, finding
[T] which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to create
[T] the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with
[T] terminals and pagers (notably with 'less').  'wdiff' is particularily
[T] useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have
[T] been refilled.
