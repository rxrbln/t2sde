[I] A program internationalization library and tools

[T] This is the GNU gettext package. It is interesting for authors or
[T] maintainers of other packages or programs which they want to see
[T] internationalized. As one step the handling of messages in different
[T] languages should be implemented. For this task GNU gettext provides
[T] the needed tools and library functions.
[T] 
[T] Users of GNU packages should also install GNU gettext because some
[T] other GNU packages will use the gettext program included in this
[T] package to internationalize the messages given by shell scripts.
