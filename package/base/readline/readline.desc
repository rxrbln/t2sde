[I] A command line parsing library

[T] The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
[T] that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.  Both
[T] Emacs and vi editing modes are available.  The Readline library includes
[T] additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command
[T] lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like
[T] history expansion on previous commands.
