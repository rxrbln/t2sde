[I] General Purpose Mouse Daemon

[T] The gpm (general purpose mouse) daemon tries to be a useful mouse
[T] server for applications running on the Linux console.  Its roots are
[T] in the "selection" package, by Andrew Haylett, and the original code
[T] comes from selection itself. This package is intended as a replacement
[T] for "selection", to provide additional facilities.  From 0.18 onward
[T] gpm supports xterm as well, so you can run mouse-sensitive
[T] applications under X, and you can easily write curses applications
[T] which support the mouse on both the Linux console and xterm. The xterm
[T] code is portable to any U*x flavour (look at sample/README).
