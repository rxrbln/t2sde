[I] A file rotation program for Apache
[T] cronolog reads log messages from its input and writes them to a set
[T] of output files, the names of which are constructed using template
[T] and the current date and time. The template uses the same format
[T] specifiers as the date(1) command. cronolog is intended to be used
[T] in conjunction with a Web server, such as Apache, to split the
[T] access log into daily or monthly logs.
