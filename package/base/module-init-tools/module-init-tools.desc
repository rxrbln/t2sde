[I] The programs needed to load and unload Linux Kernel Modules

[T] The Linux kernel allows new kernel pieces to be loaded and old ones to

[T] are called modules, and can include device drivers and filesystems among
[T] other things. This package includes program to load and unload programs
[T] both automatically and manually.
