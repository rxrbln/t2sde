[I] Software watchdog timer

[T] The software watchdog tries to "catch" computer lock-ups and will try
[T] to reboot the machine in case one occurs. It also does some a few simple
[T] tests to catch some events (currently the inability to fork and open a file)
[T] and reboot the machine if they remain so for too long.
