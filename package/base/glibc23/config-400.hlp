MENU_PKG_GLIBC
  Several different versions of the glibc library may be built.
  Among the shared and static version a special profiling version
  is available. Enabling it will result in a library libc_p.a
  suitable to profile glibc calls. It will also result in a longer
  built-time for glibc. Most people don't need this library.
