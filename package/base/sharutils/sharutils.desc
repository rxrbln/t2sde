[I] This is the set of GNU shar utilities.

[T] 'shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
[T] them for transmission by electronic mail services.  'unshar' helps
[T] unpacking shell archives after reception.  The core of both programs
[T] is initially derived from public domain.  Some modules and other
[T] code sections are freely borrowed from other GNU distributions,
[T] bringing 'shar' under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
[T] 
[T] 'uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic channel
[T] which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high order bit) of
[T] bytes.  'uudecode' does the converse transformation.  They are derived
[T] from the BSD NET/2 distribution, but enchanced with the features
[T] described in recent POSIX standards.  If you have more powerful
[T] 'uuencode' and 'uudecode' already available, you may want to use
[T] ./configure --disable-uucode' to prevent their installation.
[T] 
[T] 'remsync' allows for remote synchronization of directory trees,
[T] using electronic mail.  This part of sharutils is still alpha.
[T] You should have already installed Perl, gzip, GNU diff, GNU tar
[T] and GNU shar prior to installing remsync package.  Only Perl is
[T] really mandatory, write to me if you feel like helping to remove
[T] the other dependencies.
