[I] The GNU terminal control utilities

[T] This package contains the GNU terminal control utilities tput and
[T] tabs. tput is a program to enable shell scripts to portably use
[T] special terminal capabilities. Although its interface is similar to
[T] that of terminfo-based tput programs, it actually uses termcap. tabs
[T] is a program to set hardware terminal tab settings.
