[I] Userspace system daemon to enable security levels for Thunderbolt™ on GNU/Linux®

[T] Devices connected via Thunderbolt can be DMA masters and thus read system
[T] memory without interference of the operating system (or even the CPU). Version 3
[T] of the interface introduced 5 different security levels, in order to mitigate
[T] the aforementioned security risk that connected devices pose to the system. The
[T] security level is set by the system firmware.
