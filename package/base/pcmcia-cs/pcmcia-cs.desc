[I] The Linux PCMCIA (PC-Card) Utilities

[T] Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA or 'PC Card' support
[T] package. It includes a set of loadable kernel modules that implement
[T] a version of the Card Services applications program interface, a set
[T] of client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon that
[T] can respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and
[T] unloading drivers on demand. It supports ``hot swapping'' of most
[T] card types, so cards can be safely inserted and ejected at any time.
