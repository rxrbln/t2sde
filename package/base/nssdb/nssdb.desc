[I] The Berkeley DB NSS (name service switch) module

[T] The Berkeley DB NSS module provides an alternative means for storing
[T] configuration information traditionally kept in several plain-text
[T] files in `/etc' (e.g. `/etc/passwd').  The module uses the Berkeley DB
[T] Library to store this information in several database files in
[T] `/var/db' (e.g. `/var/db/passwd.db').  Using these databases can lead
[T] to a considerable speedup if the files in `/etc' are large (e.g. on a
[T] system with a lot of accounts).
