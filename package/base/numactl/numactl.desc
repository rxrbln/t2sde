[I] A numactl implements simple NUMA policy support

[T] A numactl implements simple NUMA policy support. A NUMA policy allows 
[T] you to tune programs by controlling the placement of memory in NUMA 
[T] (Non Uniform Memory Access) systems. The numactl program runs other 
[T] programs with a specific NUMA policy, and the libnuma shared library 
[T] ("NUMA API") can be used to set NUMA policy in applications. 
[T] Libnuma is the preferred interface to the Linux kernel NUMA policy 
[T] system calls. The package also has various tools, like numastat to 
[T] decode the kernel NUMA statistics.
