[I] A numactl implements simple NUMA policy support

[T] A numactl implements simple NUMA policy support. A NUMA policy allows
[T] you to tune programs by controlling the placement of memory in NUMA
[T] (Non Uniform Memory Access) systems. The numactl program runs other
[T] programs with a specific NUMA policy, and the libnuma shared library
[T] ("NUMA API") can be used to set NUMA policy in applications.
[T] Libnuma is the preferred interface to the Linux kernel NUMA policy
[T] system calls. The package also has various tools, like numastat to
[T] decode the kernel NUMA statistics.
