[I] Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux

[T] PAM provides a way to develop programs that are independent of
[T] authentication scheme. These programs need "authentication modules" to be
[T] attatched to them at run-time in order to work. Which authentication
[T] module is to be attatched is dependent upon the local system setup and
[T] is at the discretion of the local system administrator.
