[I] Joe's Own Editor

[T] JOE  is  a  powerful  ASCII-text  screen editor.  It has a "mode-less"
[T] user interface which is similer to many  user- friendly  PC  editors.
[T] Users  of Micro-Pro's WordStar or Borland's "Turbo" languages will feel
[T] at home.  JOE  is  a full featured UNIX screen-editor though, and has
[T] many fea- tures for editing programs and text.
[T] 
[T] JOE also emulates several other editors.  JSTAR is a close immitation
[T] of WordStar with many "JOE" extensions.  JPICO is a close immitation of
[T] the Pine  mailing  system's  PICO editor,  but with many extensions and
[T] improvements.  JMACS is a GNU-EMACS immitation.  RJOE is a  restricted
[T] version of JOE, which allowes you to edit only the files specified on
[T] the command line.
