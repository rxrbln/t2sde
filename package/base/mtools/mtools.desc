[I] Utilities to directly access DOS disks in Unix

[T] Mtools is a public domain collection of tools to allow Unix systems to
[T] manipulate MS-DOS files: read, write, and move around files on an MS-DOS
[T] filesystem (typically a floppy disk). Where reasonable, each program
[T] attempts to emulate the MS-DOS equivalent command. However, unnecessary
[T] restrictions and oddities of DOS are not emulated. For instance, it is
[T] possible to move subdirectories from one subdirectory to another.
