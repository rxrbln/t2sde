+config REISERFS_FS_SUIDDIR
+	bool "Reiserfs SUID on Directory Extension"
+	depends on REISERFS_FS
+	help
+	   As you might know, the SGID flag has a special function on
+	   directories: files within that directories will be owned by
+	   the same group that also owns the directory - which is useful
+	   for creating directories which are shared between the members
+	   of a group.
+
+	   But that only makes sense if the umask is set to give full
+	   permissions to the group (e.g. 007 or 002). Noone would do that
+	   if there is a system-wide 'users' group - so some distributions
+	   add an extra group for every user which lets the /etc/group
+	   file grow very fast and makes the admins life harder ...
+
+	   Activating this feture adds a function to the SUID flag on
+	   directories, which usually has no function at all:
+
+	   If the SUID flag is set for a diectory, all new files in that
+	   directory will get the same rights in the group-field as they
+	   have in their user-field.  So, if one sets both - SUID and SGID
+	   - on a directory, it will also work with a umask like 022 or
+	   077 and there is no more need for an extra group for every user.
+
+	   Also, the SUID flag will be set to all subdirectories of a
+	   SUID directory (as it is already now with the SGID flag on
+	   directories).
