[I] A very small replacement for SysVinit

[T] Minit can replace SysVinit completly and is daemontools-alike.
[T] Some advantages of minit:
[T] - Can respawn processes
[T] - Can take dependecies into account automatically
[T] - Is very small (linked against dietlibc)
[T] - Is quite fast
[T] - Can control daemons with a utility named pidfilehack
