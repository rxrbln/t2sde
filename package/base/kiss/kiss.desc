[I] The Keep It Simple Shell

[T] Also: Karel's Interactive Simple Shell (or Incredibly Stupid Shell, if you
[T] like).
[T]
[T] Kiss is a simple shell language interpreter, meant especially to be used
[T] with rescue disks. Kiss contains a lot of built-in commands, which means
[T] that you can put Kiss on a bootable floppy and leave out the programs cat,
[T] cd, chgrp, chown, chmod, cp, grep, kill, ln, ls, mkdir, mknod, more,
[T] mount, mv, printenv, pwd, rmdir, rm, setenv, sleep, touch, umount, wc
[T] (this list may grow..). Furthermore, having a statically linked Kiss on
[T] your hdu might help you if your /lib gets wiped out: you'll still have
[T] some programs that execute.
