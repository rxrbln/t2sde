[I] Utilities for monitoring your system and processes on your system

[T] The procps package contains a set of system utilities which provide
[T] system information. Procps includes ps, free, sessreg, skill, snice,
[T] tload, top, uptime, vmstat, w, and watch. The ps command displays
[T] a snapshot of running processes. The top command provides a
[T] repetitive update of the statuses of running processes. The free
[T] command displays the amounts of free and used memory on your system.
[T] Sessreg is a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp entries for xdm
[T] sessions. The skill command sends a terminate command (or another
[T] specified signal) to a specified set of processes. The snice
[T] command is used to change the scheduling priority of specified
[T] processes. The tload command prints a graph of the current system
[T] load average to a specified tty. The uptime command displays the
[T] current time, how long the system has been running, how many users
[T] are logged on and system load averages for the past one, five and
[T] fifteen minutes. The w command displays a list of the users who
[T] are currently logged on and what they're running. The watch program
[T] watches a running program. The vmstat command displays virtual
[T] memory statistics about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps
[T] and CPU activity.
