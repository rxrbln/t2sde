[I] Network Time Protocol (NTP) utilities

[T] The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a
[T] computer client or server to another server or reference time source,
[T] such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides client
[T] accuracies typically within a millisecond on LANs and up to a few tens
[T] of milliseconds on WANs relative to a primary server synchronized to
[T] Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) via a Global Positioning Service
[T] (GPS) receiver, for example.
