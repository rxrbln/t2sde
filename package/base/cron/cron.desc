[I] The Vixie cron daemon for executing specified programs at set times

[T] This is a version of 'cron' that is known to run on BSD 4.[23] systems.  It
[T] is functionally based on the SysV cron, which means that each user can have
[T] their own crontab file (all crontab files are stored in a read-protected
[T] directory, usually /var/cron/tabs).  No direct support is provided for
[T] 'at'; you can continue to run 'atrun' from the crontab as you have been
[T] doing.  If you don't have atrun (i.e., System V) you are in trouble.
