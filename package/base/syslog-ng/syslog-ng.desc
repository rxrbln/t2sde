[I] A syslogd replacement with enhanced, flexible configuration scheme

[T] syslog-ng, as the name shows, is a syslogd replacement, but with new
[T] functionality for the new generation. The original syslogd allows
[T] messages only to be sorted based on priority/facility pairs; syslog-ng
[T] adds the possibility to filter based on message contents using regular
[T] expressions. The new configuration scheme is intuitive and powerful.
[T] Forwarding logs over TCP and remembering all forwarding hops makes it
[T] ideal for firewalled environments.
