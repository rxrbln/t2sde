This fixes (workarounds) gridblock drawing. The original code drew the
whole area, and then started at the top overdrawing the first block and
thus missing one at the button (or reversed if reversed ...).

This changes the behaviour to always draw downwards (or reversed) and thus
at least yielding the correct gridblocks - although the performance is
bad (many block fills ...).
