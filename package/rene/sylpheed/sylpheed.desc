[I] a lightweight Gtk+ eMail client

[T] Sylpheed is a GTK+ based, lightweight, and fast email client. Almost
[T] all commands are accessible with the keyboard. It also has many
[T] features such as multiple accounts, POP3/APOP support, thread display,
[T] and multipart MIME. One of Sylpheed's future goals is to be fully
[T] internationalized. The messages are managed in the MH format, so you'll
[T] be able to use it together with another mailer that uses the MH format.
