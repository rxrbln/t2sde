[I] Samba the SMB fileserver/client

[T] Samba is a SMB server that runs on Unix and other operating
[T] systems.  It allows these operating systems (currently Unix, Netware,
[T] OS/2 and AmigaDOS) to act as a file and print server for SMB and CIFS
[T] clients. There are many Lan-Manager compatible clients such as
[T] LanManager for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, Windows 95,
[T] Linux smbfs, OS/2, Pathworks and more.
[T]
[T] Please note that there are significant security implications to
[T] running this server, and the smb.conf(5) manpage should be regarded
[T] as mandatory reading before proceeding with installation.
