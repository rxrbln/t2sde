[I] freely available web core fonts from Microsoft(R)

[T] This is a collection of freely available TrueType fonts from Microsoft(R):
[T]
[T]  * Anyone can download and install these fonts for their own use.
[T]  * Designers can specify the fonts within their Web pages. Our guide to
[T]    specifying fonts in Web pages explains how to do this.
[T]  * You may only redistribute the fonts in their original form (.exe or
[T]    .sit.hqx) and with their original file name from your Web site or
[T]    intranet site.
[T]  * You must not supply the fonts, or any derivative fonts based on them,
[T]    in any form that adds value to commercial products, such as CD-ROM or
[T]    disk based multimedia programs, application software or utilities.
[T]
[T] So since we do not add value to a commercial product by supplying this
[T] fonts, YOU download them for yourself - or unmodified from our mirror -
[T] and we also state very clearly that this is a free product from
[T] Microsoft(R) Corporation, we should not violate this "end user license
[T] agreement". We will immediately remove all references and this positive
[T] text about this very high quality fonts from this distribution if
[T] Microsoft(R) tell us to!
