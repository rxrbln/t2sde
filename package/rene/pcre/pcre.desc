[I] Perl Compatible Regulat Expressions

[T] The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
[T] pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has
[T] its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond
[T] to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is free, even for
[T] building commercial software.
[T]
[T] PCRE was originally written for the Exim MTA, but is now used by many
[T] projects, including Python, Postfix, KDE, Analog, and PHP.
