[5-ERROR] ERROR: Couldn't find SANE libraries (sane-backends). Possible reasons:
[5-ERROR]      - sane-backends isn't installed (install sane-backends before
[5-ERROR]        sane-frontends
[5-ERROR]      - the SANE header files aren't installed (if you installed
[5-ERROR]        SANE as RPM make sure you also included the sane-devel RPM)
[5-ERROR]      - the SANE libraries can't be found because /usr/local/lib/ isn't
[5-ERROR]        searched by the dynamic linker (see INSTALL for details)
