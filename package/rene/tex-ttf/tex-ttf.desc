[I] The TeX metafonts in TrueType form

[T] Maestro font family is developed as a part of Metatype project. It is
[T] based on Computer Modern fonts by Donald E. Knuth. In it's current
[T] state, the fonts are not yet ready to use. Some symbols look ugly,
[T] some are missing, font faces are not balanced, outlines are not optimal,
[T] no kerning, no hinting, no precomputed bitmaps. A lot of things must be
[T] done to make these fonts good enough.
