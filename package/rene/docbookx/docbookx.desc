[I] XML scheme for documentation

[T] DocBook is a widely used XML scheme for writing documentation and help.
[T] It has a very rich markup which allows you to use XSL stylesheets to
[T] produce various target formats such as HTML, PostScript, PDF, RTF, and
[T] HTMLHelp. ScrollKeeper was designed with an emphasis on DocBook, since
[T] it has the richest markup of all commonly used documentation formats
[T] which allows ScrollKeeper to extract the most useful information from
[T] the document itself.
[T]
[T] The DocBook DTD and stylesheets are typically distributed in packages
[T] which lack installation scripts. In the past, installation was simple
[T] enough that users could easily just copy the files into place. Now that
[T] modern XML libraries, such as libxml, support XML catalogs, correct
[T] installation of DTD's and stylesheets require proper catalog
[T] registration. The following packages are based on Norman Walsh's
[T] standard packages, but are modified to have installation scripts to
[T] correctly register the files:
