Wine will need all devices such as floppies,
cdroms, and FAT partitions labelled as you
would use then inside Windows. If you would
like to run native Windows DLLs you can. Do
this all in etc/wine.conf or in ~/.wine/config
See documentation for help.

You need to create the following directories:
C:\windows
C:\windows\system
C:\windows\Start Menu
C:\windows\Start Menu\Programs

There is still a good deal of dependency on Microsoft
supplied programs and DLLs. The best way to get it working
is to cannibalize a Windows installation of DLLs as your
program requires them as well as any programs.
Running an application 'with --debugmsg +module,+file'
will help you determine what DLLs may be needed (Except
KERNEL32, GDI32, and USER32 which are part of wine).
