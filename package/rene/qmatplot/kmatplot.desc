[I] a gnuplot-like plotting tool

[T] KMatplot is a gnuplot-like tool for plotting data sets in either two or
[T] three dimensions. It can plot many ordinary types of 2d plots, including
[T] pixmaps and contours, and 3d surfaces. It offers a full WYSIWYG mode
[T] with multiple objects on a single page.
[T]
[T] As opposite to Gnuplot, KMatplot has no scripting language but it is
[T] more clickable, so easier to use for unexperienced users. It can be
[T] used instead of Gnuplot with Octave and Scilab.
