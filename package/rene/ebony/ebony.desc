[I] Another E17 layout application

[T] Ebony is a tools for Enlightenment that creates special bits called
[T] "bg.db"s, or background bits. Because Enlightenment uses eBits for
[T] anything and everything related to graphics layout we also use them
[T] to design and display our wallpaper. Rather than simply using scaled
[T] images like in previous versions, you can use Ebony to design back-
[T] ground bits much like Etcher, including layering, relative positioning,
[T] tiling, and much more. The big advantage is that using Ebony you can
[T] have exceptional flexablility in your wallpaper design.
