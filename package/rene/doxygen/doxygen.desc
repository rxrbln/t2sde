[I] documentation system for C++, Java, IDL and C

[T] Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, Java, IDL (Corba, Microsofti
[T] and KDE-DCOP flavors) and C. 
[T]
[T] It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an
[T] off-line reference manual (in ) from a set of documented source files.
[T] There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript,
[T] hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation
[T] is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to
[T] keep the documentation consistent with the source code.
[T]
[T] Doxygen can be configured to extract the code structure from undocumented
[T] source files. This can be very useful to quickly find your way in large
[T] source distributions. The relations between the various elements are be
[T] visualized by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams,
[T] and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.
[T]
[T] You can even `abuse' doxygen for creating normal documentation.
