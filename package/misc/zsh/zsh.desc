[I] Z-Shell

[T] Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells most
[T] resembles the Korn shell (ksh). It includes enhancements of many types, notably
[T] in the command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour, filename
[T] globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and extra
[T] features drawn from tcsh.
