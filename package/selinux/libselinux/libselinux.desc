[I] SELinux library and simple utilities

[T] Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number
[T] of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
[T] mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
[T] kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
[T] improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
[T] architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
[T] of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
[T] based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
[T] Control, and Multi-level Security.
[T] libselinux provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
[T] process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
[T] decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux API.
