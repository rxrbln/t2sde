[I] SELinux binary policy manipulation library

[T] Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number
[T] of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
[T] mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
[T] kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
[T] improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
[T] architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
[T] of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
[T] based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
[T] Control, and Multi-level Security.
[T] libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
[T] It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
[T] as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific 
[T] transformations on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean 
[T] settings.
