[I] Security-Enhanced Linux Analysis Tools

[T] Security-Enhanced Linux Analysis Tools (slat) provide a systematic way
[T] to determine if security goals are achieved by a given SELinux policy
[T] configuration.  In particular, slat is concerned with information flow
[T] security goals, which describe desired paths by which information
[T] moves throughout a system.  We provide a simple syntax in which to
[T] express these goals, and tools that check a policy configuration
[T] against the goals.
