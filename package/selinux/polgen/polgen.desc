[I] MITRE policy generation tool

[T] The MITRE policy generation tools, polgen, provide a systematic way to
[T] generate policy for programs on an SELinux system. Specifically, polgen
[T] attempts to generate policy for a program based on patterns in the
[T] program's behavior. The policy that polgen suggests is tailored to the
[T] behavior of the program and includes suggestions for new system types
[T] when appropriate to support least-privilege on an SELinux system. This
[T] process is predictable and repeatable, but interactive. The user,
[T] presented with a suggested policy description, can modify that description
[T] before actual policy is produced.
