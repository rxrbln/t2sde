[I] SELinux documentation

[T] Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number
[T] of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
[T] mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
[T] kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
[T] improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
[T] architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
[T] of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
[T] based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access Control,
[T] and Multi-level Security.
[T] This package contains build instructions, porting information, and a
[T] CREDITS file for SELinux.  Some of these files will be split up into
[T] per-package files in the future, and other documentation will be added
[T] to this package (e.g. an updated form of the Configuring the SELinux
[T] Policy report).
