-* The [interface-name] is the name of the ethernet card that hosts
-  the VLAN you are talking about.
-* The vlan_id is the identifier (0-4095) of the VLAN you are operating on.
-* skb_priority is the priority in the socket buffer (sk_buff).
-* vlan_qos is the 3 bit priority in the VLAN header
-* name-type:  VLAN_PLUS_VID (vlan0005), VLAN_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD (vlan5),
-              DEV_PLUS_VID (eth0.0005), DEV_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD (eth0.5)
-* bind-type:  PER_DEVICE  # Allows vlan 5 on eth0 and eth1 to be unique.
-              PER_KERNEL  # Forces vlan 5 to be unique across all devices.
-* FLAGS:  1 REORDER_HDR  When this is set, the VLAN device will move the
-            ethernet header around to make it look exactly like a real
-            ethernet device.  This may help programs such as DHCPd which
-            read the raw ethernet packet and make assumptions about the
-            location of bytes.  If you don't need it, don't turn it on, because
-            there will be at least a small performance degradation.  Default
-            is OFF.
