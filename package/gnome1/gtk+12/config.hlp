MENU_PKG_GTK12
  Here you will find options for gtk+1.

SDECFG_PKG_GTK12_INPUT_LOCALE
  gtk+1 is unable to remap fonts, and so uses only fonts corresponding
  to your locale setting (if any). With the NLS disabled that doesn't
  make so much sense, because the gnome applications are not translated
  anyway. Check here if you want the locale fonts to be used only on
  input, for example if have only a few fonts corresponding to your
  locale and gtk+1 apps look ugly, but take into account that all other
  items, for example filenames, will not be displayed in your language.
  Don't check this option if you have NLS enabled, your codepage is not
  ISO8859-1 and you have applications translated to your language.
