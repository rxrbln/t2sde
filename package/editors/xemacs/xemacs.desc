[I] X11 version of Emacs

[T] XEmacs is a highly customizable open source text editor and application
[T] development system. It is protected under the GNU Public License and
[T] related to other versions of Emacs, in particular GNU Emacs. Its emphasis
[T] is on modern graphical user interface support and an open software
[T] development model, similar to Linux. XEmacs has an active development
[T] community numbering in the hundreds, and runs on Windows 95 and NT, Linux
[T] and nearly every other version of Unix in existence. Support for XEmacs
[T] has been supplied by Sun Microsystems, University of Illinois, Lucid,
[T] ETL/Electrotechnical Laboratory, Amdahl Corporation, BeOpen, and others,
[T] as well as the unpaid time of a great number of individual developers.
