[I] Geany is a text editor

[T] Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development
[T] environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which
[T] only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to
[T] be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment
[T] like KDE or GNOME. So it is using only the GTK2 toolkit and
[T] therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.
