[I] The vi (nvi) editor

[T] Vi is a screen oriented text editor.  Ex is a line-oriented text editor.
[T] Ex and vi are different interfaces to the same program, and it is possible
[T] to switch back and forth during an edit session.  View is the equivalent of
[T] using the -R (read-only) option of vi.
[T]
[T] This package contains the nex/nvi versions of the ex/vi text editors.
[T] Nex/nvi are intended as bug-for-bug compatible replacements for the original
[T] Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD) ex and vi programs.
