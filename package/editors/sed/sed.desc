[I] This is the GNU implementation of the POSIX stream editor

[T] The sed (Stream EDitor) editor is a stream or batch
[T] (non-interactive) editor. Sed takes text as input, performs an
[T] operation or set of operations on the text and outputs the modified
[T] text. The operations that sed performs (substitutions,
[T] deletions, insertions, etc.) can be specified in a script file or
[T] from the command line.
