[I] This is a implementation of the POSIX stream editor

[T] Minised is the fast, small sed originally distributed in the GNU toolkit
[T] and still distributed with Minix. The members of the GNU Project removed
[T] it when they built their own sed around an enhanced regexp package, but
[T] it's still better for some uses (in particular, it's faster and less
[T] memory-intensive).
