[I] An IDE for LaTeX using GNU Emacs

[T] AUC TeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
[T] writing input files for LaTeX using GNU Emacs.
[T]
[T] AUC TeX lets you run TeX/LaTeX and other LaTeX-related tools, such
[T] as a output filters or post processor from inside Emacs.  Especially
[T] `running LaTeX' is interesting, as AUC TeX lets you browse through the
[T] errors TeX reported, while it moves the cursor directly to the reported
[T] error, and displays some documentation for that particular error.  This
[T] will even work when the document is spread over several files.
