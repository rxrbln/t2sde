[I] Multi-platform 2D graphics library

[T] Cairo is a vector graphics library with cross-device output support.
[T] Currently supported output targets include the X Window System and
[T] in-memory image buffers. PostScript and PDF file output is planned.
[T] Cairo is designed to produce identical output on all output media while
[T] taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available.
[T]
[T] Cairo provides a stateful user-level API with capabilities similar to
[T] the PDF 1.4 imaging model. Cairo provides operations including stroking
[T] and filling Bezier cubic splines, transforming and compositing translucent
[T] images, and antialiased text rendering.
[T]
[T] Cairo was once named Xr, or Xr/Xc.
