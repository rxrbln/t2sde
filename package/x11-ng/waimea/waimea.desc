[I] A X11 window manager using Cairo for rendering

[T] Waimea is yet another addition to the list of window managers for the
[T] Open Group's X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 and above. Blackbox is
[T] built with C++ and based uppon blackbox.
[T]
[T] Is has a minimal resource usage, a fast and simple interface and has
[T] support for multiple desktop environments. It includes an integrated
[T] action system for build-in key-binding support as well as XRender
[T] (transparency and anti-aliasing), RandR (Rotate and Resize) support.
[T]
[T] Recently it got rewritten to use Cairo and Glitz for rendering tasks
[T] as well a SVG for most style stuff. No idea how much of the original
[T] blackbox code is left ...
