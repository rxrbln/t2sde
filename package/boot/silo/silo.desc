[I] Generic boot loader for Linux on SPARC Computers

[T] SILO (SPARC Image LOader) is a first and second stage bootloader
[T] called by the openboot prom for loading linux or solaris.
[T] It can understand berkeley fast filesystem, ext2/ext3 and sun ufs,
[T] and re-reads the silo.conf at bootup.
[T] compared to LILO (the x86 hardware bootloader),
[T] you could select which kernel to boot based on a
[T] limited choice of cpu architectures within the sparc world,
[T] and you`ld only have to install SILO once.
