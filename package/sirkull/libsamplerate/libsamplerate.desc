[I] A library for performing sample rate conversion on audio.

[T] Secret Rabbit Code is a sample rate converter for audio. It is capable 
[T] of arbitrary and time varying conversions. It can downsample by a factor 
[T] of 12 and upsample by the same factor. The ratio of input and output 
[T] sample rates can be a real number. The conversion ratio can also vary 
[T] with time for speeding up and slowing down effects.
