[I] Anti-aliased oscillator plugins for LADSPA.

[T] This plugin contains two anti-aliased oscillators, both based on the 
[T] concept of using precomputed bandlimited Dirac pulses to construct the 
[T] classical waveforms. They are both memory and CPU efficient. The first 
[T] one produces a flat spectrum (impulses) and the second generates a 
[T] sawtooth waveform.
