[I] A secure, lightweight ident (RFC1413) daemon for Linux.

[T] slidentd is a minimal ident (RFC1413) daemon which runs from inetd,
[T] xinetd, or tcpserver. It is similar in purpose to pidentd, which is
[T] installed with most Linux systems. However its design goals are somewhat
[T] different. It was written because the author wanted a very small, simple
[T] daemon that would not give out any sensitive information (such as
[T] usernames). In this regard it is not RFC compliant (RFC 1413 requires
[T] the daemon to be insecure by default with secure settings as an option).
[T] Instead of returning the username it returns a random token, but 
[T] logs both the token and the actual username.
