[I] A random password generator

[T] apg generates several random passwords. It uses several password
[T] generation algorithms (currently two) and a built-in pseudo random
[T] number generator.
[T] 
[T] Default algorithm is pronounceable password generation algorithm
[T] designed by Morrie Gasser and described in A Random Word Generator For
[T] Pronounceable Passwords National Technical Information Service (NTIS)
[T] AD-A-017676.  The original paper is very old and had never been put
[T] online, so I have to use NIST implementation described in FIPS-181.
[T] 
[T] Another algorithm is simple random character generation algorithm, but
[T] it uses four user-defined symbol sets to produce random password.  It
[T] means that user can choose type of symbols that should appear in pass-
[T] word. Symbol sets are: numeric symbol set (0,...,9) , capital letters
[T] symbol set (A,...,Z) , small letters symbol set (a,...,z) and special
[T] symbols symbol set (#,@,!,...).
[T] 
[T] apg also have the ability to check generated password quality using
[T] dictionary.
