[I] A simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon

[T] Qjackctl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server
[T] daemon, specifically for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure. It is
[T] written in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using Qt
[T] Designer. It provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK
[T] daemon parameters, which are properly saved between sessions, and a way
[T] to control of the status of the audio server daemon. With time, this
[T] primordial interface has become richer by including an enhanced patchbay
[T] and connection control features.
