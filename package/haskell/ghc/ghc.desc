[I] The Glasgow (flagship) Haskell Compiler

[T] Haskell is an advanced purely functional programming language. An open
[T] source product of more than twenty years of cutting edge research, it
[T] allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With
[T] strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency
[T] and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active
[T] community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable
[T] high-quality software.
