[I] A jukebox server that controls music playback (MP3, Ogg, and Flac).

[T] Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows
[T] remote access for playing music (MP3, Ogg Vorbis,
[T] and Flac) and managing playlists. The design focus
[T] is on integrating a computer into a stereo system
[T] that provides control for music playback over a
[T] local network. Currently, it includes a Web
[T] interface, phpMp, a GTK frontend, gtk2mp, 
[T] a command line tool, mpc, and a dock app, WMmp. 
[T] The goals are to be easy to install and use, to 
[T] have minimal resource requirements, and to be 
[T] stable and flexible.
