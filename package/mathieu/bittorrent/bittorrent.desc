[I] BitTorrent

[T] BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely 
[T] easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.
[T] Whenever more than one person is downloading at once 
[T] they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving 
[T] the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many 
[T] simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server 
[T] remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new 
[T] upload capacity.
