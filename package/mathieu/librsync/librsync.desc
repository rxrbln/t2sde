[I] librsync, network-delta library 

[T] librsync implements the rolling-checksum algorithm of remote file 
[T] synchronization that was popularized by the rsync utility and is used 
[T] in rproxy. This algorithm transfers the differences between 2 files 
[T] without needing both files on the same system.
