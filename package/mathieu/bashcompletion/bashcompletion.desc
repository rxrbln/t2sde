[I] Programmable completion for bash.

[T] Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and extend its
[T] standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines with just a 
[T] few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to complete on 
[T] hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str [Tab] and 
[T] getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX manual. 
[T] mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems from the 
[T] host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets in 
[T] Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable completion 
[T] routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of 
[T] typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis.
