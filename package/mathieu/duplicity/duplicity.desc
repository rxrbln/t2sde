[I] Duplicity, Encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup using the rsync algorithm

[T] Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and 
[T] uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses 
[T] librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the 
[T] parts of files that have changed since the last backup. Because duplicity 
[T] uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from 
[T] spying and/or modification by the server.
