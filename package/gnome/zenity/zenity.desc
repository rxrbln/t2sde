[I] A Gtk+ dialog tool

[T] Zenity is a tool that allows you to display Gtk+ dialog boxes from the
[T] command line and through shell scripts. It is similar to gdialog, but is
[T] intended to be saner. It comes from the same family as dialog, Xdialog,
[T] and cdialog, but it surpasses those projects by having a cooler name.
