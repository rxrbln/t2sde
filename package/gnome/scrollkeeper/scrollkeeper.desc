[I] A Documentation Cataloging System

[T] ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation. It manages
[T] documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source Metadata
[T] Framework (OMF)) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers to
[T] find, sort, and search the document catalog. It will also be able to
[T] communicate with catalog servers on the Net to search for documents
[T] which are not on the local system.
