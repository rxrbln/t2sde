[I] A high-performance CORBA ORB (object request broker)

[T] ORBit2 is a high-performance CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
[T] Architecture) ORB (object request broker). It allows programs to
[T] send requests and receive replies from other programs, regardless
[T] of the locations of the two programs. CORBA is an architecture that
[T] enables communication between program objects, regardless of the
[T] programming language they're written in or the operating system they
[T] run on.
[T]
[T] You will need to install this package if you want to run programs that use
[T] the ORBit2 implementation of CORBA technology, e.g. GNOME.
