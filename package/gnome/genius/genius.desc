[I] An arbitrary precision integer and multiple precision floating point calculator

[T] Genius is an arbitrary precision integer and multiple precision floating
[T] point calculator. It includes its own programming language similar in
[T] some aspects to C, bc, or Pascal. It can deal with rational numbers and
[T] complex numbers. It has matrix support as well. It uses the gmp library so
[T] it is very fast for calculations of large numbers. It has a command line
[T] and a GNOME interface. The GNOME interface supports plotting functions
[T] and 3D surfaces.
