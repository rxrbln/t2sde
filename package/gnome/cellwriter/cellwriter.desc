[I] A grid-entry handwriting input panel

[T] CellWriter is a grid-entry natural handwriting input panel. As you
[T] write characters into the cells, your writing is instantly recognized
[T] at the character level. When you press 'Enter' on the panel, the input
[T] you entered is sent to the currently focused application as if typed
[T] on the keyboard. Writer-dependent, CellWriter learns your handwriting
[T] for reliable recognition. Correcting preprocessor algorithms account
[T] for digitizer noise, differing stroke order, direction, and number of
[T] strokes. Unicode support enables you to write in any language.
