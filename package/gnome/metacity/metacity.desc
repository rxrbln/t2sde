[I] Yet another window manager for the GNOME project

[T] Sun has decided to drop Sawfish in favour of Metacity for its release
[T] of GNOME 2.
[T]
[T] This decision has been based on issues such as accessibility,
[T] maintainability of the code, documentation, multi-head support and a
[T] general eagerness from the community to commit to Metacity.
