[I] A C++ Framework for creating GNOME apps

[T] Bakery is a C++ Framework for creating GNOME apps using gtkmm. It
[T] provides a Document/View architecture, but it doesn't force you to use
[T] the whole architecture. It can use XML as a Document storage format and
[T] provides default functionality, which can be easily customized.
[T] Bakery makes it easy to start developing GNOME applications and gives
[T] your application structure and contains a few utility classes.
