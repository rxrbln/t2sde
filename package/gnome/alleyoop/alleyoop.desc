[I] A GNOME frontend to the Valgrind memory checker

[T] Alleyoop is a GNOME frontend to the Valgrind memory checker. Its features
[T] include a right-click context menu to intelligently suppress errors
[T] or launch an editor on the source file, jumping to the exact line of
[T] the error condition. A searchbar at the top of the viewer can be used
[T] to limit the viewable errors to those that match the regex criteria
[T] entered. A fully functional Suppressions editor is also included.
