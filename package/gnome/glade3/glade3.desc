[I] A User Interface Builder for Gtk+ and Gnome

[T] Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces
[T] for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment, released under
[T] the GNU GPL License.
[T] The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the
[T] libglade library these can be loaded by applications dynamically as needed.
[T] By using libglade, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming
[T] languages including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, C#, Pike, Ruby, Haskell,
[T] Objective Caml and Scheme. Adding support for other languages is easy ,too.
