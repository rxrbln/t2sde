[I] An extensible window manager

[T] Sawfish (the window manager formerly known as Sawmill) is an extensible
[T] window manager using a Lisp-based extension language. All window
[T] decorations are configurable and all user-interface policy is controlled
[T] through the language. Its aim is to manage windows in the most flexible
[T] and attractive manner possible. As such it does not implement desktop
[T] backgrounds, application docks, or other things that may be achieved
[T] through separate applications. Sawfish is mostly GNOME-compliant; almost
[T] all configuration may be made through a graphical interface.
