[I] a CD/DVD burning application for Gnome

[T] GnomeBaker is a GTK2/Gnome CD/DVD burning application. I've been writing
[T] it in my spare time so progress is fairly slow. It's more of a personal
[T] project as I wanted to have a go at developing on Linux and I figured that
[T] as I had got this far I may as well let it loose on the world. Maybe someone
[T] will like it and use it.
