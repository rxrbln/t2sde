[I] GdMap is a tool which allows to visualize disk space

[T] GdMap is a tool which allows to visualize disk space. Ever wondered why
[T] your hard disk is full or what directory and files take up most of the
[T] space? With GdMap these questions can be answered quickly. To display
[T] directory structures cushion treemaps are used which visualize a complete
[T] folder or even the whole hard drive with one picture.
