[I] Low-vision and blind users access to standard Gtk+2

[T] The gnopernicus project enables users with limited vision, or no vision,
[T] to use the Gnome 2 desktop and Gnome/GTK+-2 applications effectively.
[T] By providing automated focus tracking and  fullscreen magnification,
[T] Gnopernicus will aid low-vision Gnome users, and its screen reader features
[T] will allow low-vision and blind users access to standard GTK+2 and
[T] Java-based GUI applications via speech and Braille output. By leveraging
[T] Gnome's built-in accessibility framework,  Gnopernicus makes interacting
[T] with applications more efficient for these users, and enables use of the
[T] Gnome 2 desktop for some users who otherwise would have no access to Gnome.
