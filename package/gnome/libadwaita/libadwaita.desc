[I] Building blocks for modern GNOME applications

[T] Adwaita is the name of GNOMEâ€™s visual language and identity.
[T] This new libadwaita library intends to extend that concept by being the
[T] missing code part of Adwaita. The library will be implemented as a
[T] direct GTK 4 continuation and replacement of libhandy.
