[I] Python/ORBit (CORBA) Bindings

[T] PyORBit is a Python binding for the ORBit2 CORBA ORB. It was developped to
[T] suit the needs of the bonobo bindings in GNOME-Python, but is usable for
[T] other purposes as well. It aims to follow the standard Python language
[T] mapping for CORBA. It can generate stubs at runtime from typelibs,
[T] IDL files, or by introspecting remote objects using ORBit2's IModule
[T] typelib capabilities.
