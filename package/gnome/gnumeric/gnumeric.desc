[I] A computer spreadsheet program used to manipulate and analyze numeric data

[T] This is the Gnumeric, the GNOME spreadsheet program. If you are
[T] familiar with Excel, you should be ready to use Gnumeric. We have
[T] tried to clone all of the good features and stay as compatible as
[T] possible with Excel in terms of usability. Hopefully we left the bugs
[T] behind :). Gnumeric is the upcomming GNOME spreadsheet application.
