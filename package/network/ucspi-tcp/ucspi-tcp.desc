[I] Command-line tools for building TCP client-server applications

[T] tcpserver waits for incoming connections and, for each connection,
[T] runs a program of your choice. Your program receives environment
[T] variables showing the local and remote host names, IP addresses,
[T] and port numbers.
[T] tcpserver offers a concurrency limit to protect you from running
[T] out of processes and memory. When you are handling 40 (by default)
[T] simultaneous connections, tcpserver smoothly defers acceptance of
[T] new connections.
[T] tcpserver also provides TCP access control features, similar to
[T] tcp-wrappers/tcpd's hosts.allow but much faster. Its access control
[T] rules are compiled into a hashed format with cdb, so it can easily
[T] deal with thousands of different hosts.
[T] This package includes a recordio tool that monitors all the input
[T] and output of a server.
[T] tcpclient makes a TCP connection and runs a program of your choice.
[T] It sets up the same environment variables as tcpserver.
