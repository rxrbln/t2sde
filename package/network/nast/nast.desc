[I] A packet sniffer and LAN analysis tool

[T] Nast is a packet sniffer and a LAN analyzer based on Libnet and
[T] Libpcap. It can sniff the packets on a network interface in normal mode
[T] or in promiscuous mode. It dumps the headers of packets and the payload in
[T] ASCII or ASCII-hex format. Various packet filters can be applied. The data
[T] sniffed can be saved in a separate file. As an analysis tool, it can check
[T] for other NICs on the network which are set in promiscuous mode, build a
[T] list of all hosts on a LAN, find a gate & shy, perform port scanning
[T] on a multiple hosts, catch daemon banners, follow the TCP data stream,
[T] reset a connection, and determine whether a link type is a hub or switch.
