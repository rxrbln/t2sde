[I] An ethernet traffic monitoring and problem reporting tool

[T] Arphound is a tool that listens to all traffic on an ethernet
[T] network interface. It reports IP/MAC address pairs as well as
[T] events such as IP conflicts, IP changes, IP addresses with no
[T] RDNS, various ARP spoofing, and packets not using the expected
[T] gateway. Reporting is done to stdout, to a specified file, or
[T] to syslog in a format that can be easily parsed by scripts.
