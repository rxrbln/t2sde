[I] Virtualization tool designed to test complex network simulation scenarios

[T] VNUML (Virtual Network User Mode Linux) is an open-source general purpose
[T] virtualization tool designed to quickly define and test complex network
[T] simulation scenarios based on the great User Mode Linux (UML)
[T] virtualization software.
[T] VNUML is aimed to help in testing network applications and services over
[T] complex testbeds made of several nodes (even tenths) and networks inside
[T] one Linux machine, without involving the investment and management
[T] complexity needed to create them using real equipment.
