[I] IPv6 Router Advertisement Daemon

[T] The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD systems
[T] acting as IPv6 routers. It sends Router Advertisement messages, specified
[T] by RFC 2461, to a local Ethernet LAN periodically and when requested by
[T] a node sending a Router Solicitation message. These messages are required
[T] for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.
