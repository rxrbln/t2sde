[I] A telecommunication system for UNIX systems

[T] HylaFAX is a telecommunication system for UNIX systems. It supports sending
[T] facsimile, receiving facsimile, polled retrieval of facsimile, transparent
[T] shared data use of the modem and sending alpha-numeric pages. The software is
[T] structured around a client-server architecture. Fax modems may reside on a
[T] single machine on a network and clients can submit outbound jobs from any
[T] machine that can communicate with the machine on which the modems reside. An
[T] access control mechanism is included to control which users on which machines
[T] may access a server.
