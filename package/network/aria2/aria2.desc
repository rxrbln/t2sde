[I] aria2 - The ultra fast download utility

[T] aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are
[T] HTTP(S), FTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink. aria2 can download a file from
[T] multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download
[T] bandwidth. It supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP and
[T] BitTorrent at the same time, while the data downloaded from
[T] HTTP(S)/FTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm. Using Metalink's
[T] chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates chunks of data while
[T] downloading a file like BitTorrent.
