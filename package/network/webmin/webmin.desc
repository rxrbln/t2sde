[I] A web-based interface for system administration for Unix

[T] Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix.
[T] Using any browser that supports tables and forms (and Java for the
[T] File Manager module), you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file
[T] sharing and so on.
[T] Webmin consists of a simple web server, and a number of CGI programs
[T] which directly update system files like /etc/inetd.conf and
[T] /etc/passwd. The web server and all CGI programs are written in Perl
[T] version 5, and use no non-standard Perl modules.
