[I] Psion Link Protocol library and tools

[T] Plptools contain a set of libraries and utilities for enabling Unix
[T] (mainly Linux) systems to communicate with a Psion palmtop over a serial
[T] line. On Linux, a connection over IrDA, using the IrCOMM feature is also
[T] possible. A shared library encapsulates the highlevel protocol
[T] (PsionLinkProtocol) and thus makes it easy to write applications without
[T] extensive knowledge of the protocol itself. A daemon (ncpd) handles the
[T] serial connection and provides it's services on a local TCP socket.
