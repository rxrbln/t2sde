[I] A tool to generate DNS data from an LDAP database

[T] ldap2dns is a program to create DNS records directly from an LDAP
[T] database. It can and should be be used to replace the secondary name
[T] server by a second primary one. ldap2dns helps reduce all kinds of
[T] administration overhead. No more flat file editing, no more zone
[T] file editing. After having installed ldap2dns, the administrator
[T] only has to access the LDAP database. If she desires, she can add
[T] access control for each zone, create a special GUI, or use one of
[T] the existing LDAP GUIs and add all other kind of zone and resource
[T] record information without interfering with the DNS server. ldap2dns
[T] is designed to write an ASCII data file used by tinydns (from the
[T] djbdns package), or a zonename.db -file as used by named.
