[I] An NNTP server for small leaf sites

[T] Leafnode is a news server, suitable for small, limited-bandwidth sites
[T] with only a few users (and useful for offline news reading). Leafnode
[T] keeps track of which groups are being read and downloads only articles
[T] in those groups. Leafnode has been designed to require no maintenance
[T] and to be easy to set up.
