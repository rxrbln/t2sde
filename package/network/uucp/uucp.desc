[I] Unix to Unix copy

[T] Short for Unix-to-Unix Copy, a Unix utility and protocol that enables
[T] one computer to send files to another computer over a direct serial
[T] connection or via modems and the telephone system. For most file 
[T] transfer applications, UUCP has been superseded by other protocols, 
[T] such as FTP, SMTP and NNTP.
