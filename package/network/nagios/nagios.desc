[I] Nagios host and service monitor

[T] NagiosŪ is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of
[T] network problems before your clients, end-users or managers do.
[T] It has been designed to run under the Linux operating system,
[T] but works fine under most *NIX variants as well.
[T]
[T] The monitoring daemon runs intermittent checks on hosts and services
[T] you specify using external "plugins" which return status information
[T] to Nagios. When problems are encountered, the daemon can send
[T] notifications out to administrative contacts in a variety of different
[T] ways (email, instant message, SMS, etc.).
[T] Current status information, historical logs, and reports can all be
[T] accessed via a web browser.
