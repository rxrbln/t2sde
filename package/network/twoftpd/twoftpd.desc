[I] Simple secure efficient FTP server

[T] This is twoftpd, a new FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
[T] efficient.  None of the commands can cause execution of other programs,
[T] and the normal model of execution does a chroot to the logged in user's
[T] directory immediately after authentication.
[T]
[T] The name "twoftpd" comes from the fact that there were two parts to the
[T] server -- an authenticating front end, which contains no file or data
[T] transfer code, and a back end, which contains all the data transfer
[T] code.
