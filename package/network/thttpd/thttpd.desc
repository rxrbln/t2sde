[I] A simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server

[T] Thttpd is a simple, small, fast and secure HTTP server. It doesn't have
[T] a lot of special features but it suffices for most uses of the Web. It's
[T] faster than Apache and it has one extremely useful feature that no other
[T] server currently has - URL-traffic-based throttling.
