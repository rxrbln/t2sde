[I] A non-interactive network retriever

[T] GNU Wget is a free network utility to retrieve files from the World
[T] Wide Web using HTTP and FTP, the two most widely used Internet
[T] protocols. It works non-interactively, thus enabling work in the
[T] background, after having logged off.
[T]
[T] The recursive retrieval of HTML pages, as well as FTP sites is
[T] supported -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and home
[T] pages, or traverse the web like a WWW robot (Wget understands
[T] /robots.txt).
