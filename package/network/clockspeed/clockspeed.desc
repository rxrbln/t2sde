[I] clockspeed - system clock synchronisation utilities 

[T] clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a persistently 
[T] fast or slow system clock. Given a few time measurements from a reliable 
[T] source, it computes and then eliminates the clock skew. 
[T]
[T] sntpclock checks another system's NTP clock, and prints the results in a 
[T] format suitable for input to clockspeed. sntpclock is the simplest 
[T] available NTP/SNTP client. 
[T]
[T] taiclock and taiclockd form an even simpler alternative to SNTP. 
[T] They are suitable for precise time synchronization over a local area 
[T] network, without the hassles and potential security problems of an NTP 
[T] server. 
[T]
[T] Note:
[T] This version of clockspeed can use the Pentium RDTSC tick counter or the 
[T] Solaris gethrtime() nanosecond counter.
