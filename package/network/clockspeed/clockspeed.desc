[I] System clock synchronisation utilities

[T] Clockspeed uses a hardware tick counter to compensate for a persistently
[T] fast or slow system clock. Given a few time measurements from a reliable
[T] source, it computes and then eliminates the clock skew.
[T]
[T] Sntpclock checks another system's NTP clock, and prints the results in a
[T] format suitable for input to clockspeed. sntpclock is the simplest
[T] available NTP/SNTP client.
[T]
[T] Taiclock and taiclockd form an even simpler alternative to SNTP.
[T] They are suitable for precise time synchronization over a local area
[T] network, without the hassles and potential security problems of an NTP
[T] server.
[T]
[T] This version of clockspeed can use the Pentium RDTSC tick counter or the
[T] Solaris gethrtime() nanosecond counter.
