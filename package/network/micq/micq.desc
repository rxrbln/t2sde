[I] A ICQ Client

[T] mICQ (Matt's ICQ Clone) is a portable, small, yet powerful console-based
[T] ICQ client. It supports password changing, auto-away,
[T] creation of new accounts, and other features that makes it a very complete
[T] yet simple client. It is able to send and receive messages from
[T] the ICQ network, list users that are offline and online
[T] (including their online status), search for users by email address,
[T] and look up basic (name, UIN, email) information.
