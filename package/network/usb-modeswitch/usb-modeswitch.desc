[I] A mode switching tool for controlling 'multi-mode' USB devices.

[T] More and more USB devices (especially high-speed WAN stuff, based on cell
[T] phone chipsets which are able to change their USB connection mode) have
[T] their MS Windows drivers onboard; when plugged in for the first time they
[T] act like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there.
[T] After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) the driver switches
[T] the mode internally, the storage device vanishes (in most cases), and a
[T] new device (like an USB modem) shows up. Modem maker "Option" calls that
[T] feature "ZeroCD (TM)" since it eliminates the need for shipping a separate
[T] driver carrier
