[I] A network monitoring tool for tracking IP/MAC addresses on a network

[T] The arpwatch NG package contains arpwatch and arpsnmp. Both
[T] utilities monitor Ethernet or FDDI network traffic and build
[T] databases of Ethernet/IP address pairs, and can report certain
[T] changes. It is based upon the original, but old, arpwatch
[T] package.
