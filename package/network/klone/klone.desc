[I] An embeddable Web server and SDK to write dynamic HTML pages using C/C++

[T] KLone is a fully-featured, multi-platform framework which allows dynamic
[T] Web pages to be written in C/C++ (with the usual &amp;amp;lt;% code
[T] %&amp;amp;gt; style). The pages can then be embedded (in compressed
[T] and/or encrypted form) into a single executable that also contains
[T] KLone's high-performance HTTP/S server. Given its nature, it can be linked
[T] natively to any C/C++ library (database, XML, graphics, etc. ), without
[T] an intermediate layer, and it is especially suited for low-resource
[T] (embedded) systems.
