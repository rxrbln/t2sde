[I] Host AP driver for Intersil Prism2/2.5/3

[T] This is a Linux driver for wireless LAN cards based on Intersil's
[T] Prism2/2.5/3 chipset. The driver supports a so called Host AP mode, i.e.,
[T] it takes care of IEEE 802.11 management functions in the host computer and
[T] acts as an access point. This does not require any special firmware for the
[T] wireless LAN card. In addition to this, it has support for normal station
[T] operations in BSS and possible also in IBSS. WPA and RSN (WPA2) is
[T] supported when used with accompanied tools, wpa_supplicant (WPA/RSN
[T] Supplicant) and hostapd (WPA/RSN Authenticator).
