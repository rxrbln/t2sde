[I] TCP/IP based routing protocol implementation

[T] GNU Zebra is free software (distributed under GNU Generic Public License)
[T] that manages TCP/IP based routing protocols. It supports BGP-4 protocol as
[T] described in RFC1771 (A Border Gateway Protocol 4) as well as RIPv1, RIPv2
[T] and OSPFv2. Unlike traditional, Gated based, monolithic architectures and
[T] even the so-called "new modular architectures" that remove the burden of
[T] processing routing functions from the cpu and utilize special ASIC chips
[T] instead, Zebra software offers true modularity.
