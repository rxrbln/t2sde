[I] Simple proxy nameserver

[T] The Domain Name Relay Daemon (DNRD) is a simple "proxy" nameserver.
[T] It is meant to be used for home networks that can connect to the internet
[T] using one of several ISP's.
[T] 
[T] DNRD is pretty simple.  It takes DNS queries from hosts, and forwards them
[T] to the "real" DNS server.  It takes DNS replies from the DNS server, and
[T] forwards them to the client.  What makes DNRD special is that it can be
[T] configured to forward to different DNS servers depending on what ISP you
[T] are dialing.
