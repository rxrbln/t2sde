[I] RADIUS /bin/login replacement

[T] Radiusclient is a /bin/login replacement which gets called 
[T] by a getty to log in a user and to setup the user's login 
[T] environment. 
[T] Normal login programs just check the login name and password 
[T] which the user entered against the local password file 
[T] (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow). In contrast to that Radiusclient 
[T] also uses the RADIUS protocol to authenticate the user.
