[I] SSL encryption wrapper between client and server.

[T] The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption wrapper
[T] between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or remote server. It
[T] can be used to add SSL functionality to commonly used inetd daemons
[T] like POP2, POP3, and IMAP servers without any changes in the programs'
[T] code. It will negotiate an SSL connection using the OpenSSL or SSLeay
[T] libraries. It calls the underlying crypto libraries, so stunnel
[T] supports whatever cryptographic algorithms you compiled into your
[T] crypto package.
