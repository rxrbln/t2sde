[I] A tiny, fast authoritative nameserver using LDAP as backend 

[T] ldapdns is a fast and robust authoritative nameserver using  
[T] LDAP backend for storing records. 
[T] It's extremely simple, and it does not run under user-control as root. 
[T] it's ideal for small and large installations, because it queries 
[T] the ldap server directly, updates are immediate. you don't have 
[T] to rebuild constant databases our other files.
