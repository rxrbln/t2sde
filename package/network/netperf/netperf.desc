[I] Performance measurement of many different types of networking

[T] Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of many
[T] different types of networking including Unix Domain Sockets and TCP and
[T] UDP via BSD Sockets. It provides tests for both unidirectional throughput
[T] and end-to-end latency.
