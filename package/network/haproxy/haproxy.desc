[I] A high performance TCP and HTTP load balancer

[T] HAproxy is a high-performance and highly-robust TCP and HTTP load
[T] balancer which provides cookie-based persistence, content-based switching,
[T] advanced traffic regulation with surge protection, automatic failover,
[T] run-time regex-based header control, Web-based reporting, advanced
[T] logging to help trouble-shooting buggy applications and/or networks,
[T] and a few other features. Its own event-driven state machine achieves
[T] 20,000 hits per second and surpasses GigaEthernet on modern hardware,
[T] even with tens of thousands of simultaneous connections.
