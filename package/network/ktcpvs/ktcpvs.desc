[I] Kernel TCP Virtual Server

[T] KTCPVS stands for Kernel TCP Virtual Server. It implements application-
[T] level load balancing inside the Linux kernel, so called Layer-7 switching.
[T] Since the overhead of layer-7 switching in user-space is very high, it is
[T] good to implement it inside the kernel in order to avoid the overhead of
[T] context switching and memory copying between user-space and kernel-space.
[T] Although the scalability of KTCPVS is lower than that of IPVS (IP Virtual
[T] Server), it is flexible, because the content of request is known before 
[T] the request is redirected to one server.
