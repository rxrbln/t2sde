[I] A program to ping hosts in parallel

[T] fping is a ping(1) like program which uses the Internet Control
[T] Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is up.
[T] fping is different from ping in that you can specify any number of
[T] hosts on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of
[T] hosts to ping. Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or
[T] replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next
[T] host in a round-robin fashion. If a host replies, it is noted and
[T] removed from the list of hosts to check. If a host does not respond
[T] within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it will be considered
[T] unreachable.
