[I] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server and relay agent

[T] The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Server, dhcpd, implements the Dynamic
[T] Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap Protocol
[T] (BOOTP). DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request and be assigned
[T] IP addresses, and also to discover information about the network to which
[T] they are attached. BOOTP provides similar functionality, with certain
[T] restrictions.
