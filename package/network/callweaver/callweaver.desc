[I] A community driven software PBX project

[T] Callweaver is a community driven software PBX project. The most important
[T] differences between Callweaver and Asterisk are built-in STUN support,
[T] the use of SpanDSP for better codecs and full T. 38 fax over IP support,
[T] Sqlite instead of Berkeley DB, universal jitterbuffer, POSIX timers to
[T] avoid Zaptel timing dependencies, greater speed, more efficient dialplan
[T] execution, and greater stability.
