[I] Aend (almost) arbitrary TCP/IP packets to network hosts

[T] hping2 is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. 
[T] The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping2 
[T] isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, 
[T] ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to 
[T] send files between a covered channel, and many other features.
