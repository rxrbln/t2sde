[I] A light HTTP server 

[T] Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility--all of these describe LightTPD 
[T] which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a webserver; as it is designed and 
[T] optimized for high performance environments. With a small memory footprint 
[T] compared to other web-servers, effective management of the cpu-load, and 
[T] advanced feature set (FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting 
[T] and many more) LightTPD is the perfect solution for every server that is 
[T] suffering load problems. And best of all it's Open Source.
