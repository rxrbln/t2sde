[I] A light HTTP server

[T] Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility - all of these describe
[T] lighttpd (lighty) which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a webserver;
[T] as it is designed and optimized for high performance environments. With
[T] a small memory footprint compared to other web-servers, effective
[T] management of the cpu-load, and advanced feature set (FastCGI, SCGI,
[T] Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and many more) lighttpd is the
[T] perfect solution for every server that is suffering load problems.
