[I] Ethernet bridge tables

[T] The ebtables program is a filtering tool for a bridging firewall.
[T] The filtering is focussed on the Link Layer Ethernet frame fields.
[T] Apart from filtering, it also gives the ability to alter the
[T] Ethernet MAC addresses and implement a brouter.
[T] The ebtables tool can be used together with the other Linux
[T] filtering tools, like iptables. There are no incompatibility issues.
