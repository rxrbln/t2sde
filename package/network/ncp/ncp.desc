[I] A fast file copy tool for LANs

[T] ncp is an utility for copying files in a LAN. It has absolutely no
[T] security or integrity checking, no throttling, no features, except
[T] one: you don't have to type the coordinates of your peer. It works
[T] with IPv6, too! The files are copied with tar over TCP.
