[I] A C client library for interfacing to a memcached server

[T] libmemcached is a C client library for interfacing to a memcached server.
[T] It has been designed to be light on memory usage, thread safe and to
[T] provide full access to server side methods. It also implements several
[T] command line tools: memcat, memflush, memrm, memstat, and memslap (for
[T] load generation). The library has been designed to allow for different
[T] hashing methods on keys, partitioning by keys, and to use consistent
[T] hashing for distribution.
