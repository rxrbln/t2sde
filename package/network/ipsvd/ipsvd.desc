[I] Internet protocol service daemons

[T] ipsvd is a set of internet protocol service daemons. It currently
[T] includes a TCP/IP service daemon, and a UDP/IP service daemon.
[T]
[T] An internet protocol service (ipsv) daemon waits for incoming connections
[T] on a local socket. On incoming connections, the ipsv daemon conditionally
[T] runs an arbitrary program with standard input reading from the socket,
[T] and standard output writing to the socket, that handles the connection.
[T] Standard error is used for logging.
[T]
[T] ipsv daemons can be told to read and follow pre-defined instructions on
[T] how to handle incoming connections. It's possible to run different
[T] programs, or to set a different environment, or to deny a connection, or
[T] to set a per host concurrency limit, depending on the client's address or
[T] hostname.
[T]
[T] ipsvd can be used to run services normally run by inetd, xinetd, or
[T] tcpserver.
