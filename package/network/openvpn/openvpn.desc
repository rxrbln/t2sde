[I] A VPN daemon

[T] OpenVPN is a robust and highly configurable VPN (Virtual Private Network)
[T] daemon which can be used to securely link two or more private networks using
[T] an encrypted tunnel over the internet.
[T] So while OpenVPN supports standards which are consistent with this goal such
[T] as SSL/TLS-based session authentication, RSA Certificates, X509 public key
[T] infrastructure, and user-space tunneling of IP networks over TUN or TAP
[T] virtual devices, it does not support IPSec at this time.
