[I] Access to the internet through a HTTP proxy

[T] The concept of Transconnect originated during a chat session with a
[T] friend. We knew that HTTP proxies support CONNECT feature to allow for
[T] https connections to remote hosts. There are programs which allow you to
[T] tunnel through a proxy, but we thought it would be wonderful if the user
[T] did not have to setup a tunnel for each host:port he wants to connect to.
