[I] Helps to manage ssh and GPG keys in a convenient and secure manner

[T] Keychain acts as a frontend to ssh-agent and ssh-add, but allows you
[T] to easily have one long running ssh-agent process per system, rather
[T] than the norm of one ssh-agent per login session.
[T] 
[T] This dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your
[T] passphrase. With keychain, you only need to enter a passphrase once
[T] every time your local machine is rebooted. Keychain also makes it easy
[T] for remote cron jobs to securely "hook in" to a long running ssh-agent
[T] process, allowing your scripts to take advantage of key-based logins.
