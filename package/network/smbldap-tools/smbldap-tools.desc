[I] Scripts to manage Samba users on LDAP

[T] SMBLDAP-TOOLS is a package containing some useful scripts to manage
[T] users/groups when you're using LDAP as source of users/groups datas
[T] (for Unix and for Samba). We developed then used those scripts in our
[T] SAMBA-LDAP PDC HOWTO to add/del/mod users and groups. Version 0.7 is
[T] adapted to Samba 2.2.7 and up, and the 0.8 branch works with Samba 3.0
[T] (some work probably needed for Samba TNG). This IDEALX set of
[T] contributions is officially integrated into Samba. Check out the CVS
[T] if possible, usually newer is better with these tools.
