[I] A network connection profiler
 
[T] SANCP (Security Analyst Network Connection Profiler) is a network security
[T] tool designed to collect statistical information regarding network traffic,
[T] as well as, collect the traffic itself in pcap format, all for the purpose
[T] of: auditing, historical analysis, and network activity discovery.
[T] Rules can be used to distinguish normal from abnormal traffic and support
[T] tagging connections with: rule id, node id and status id.
[T] From an intrusion detection standpoint, every connection is an event that
[T] must be validated through some means. Sancp uses rules to identify, record,
[T] and tag traffic of interest.
