[I] Security Analyst Network Connection Profiler 

[T] This is a network security tool designed to collect statistical information 
[T] regarding network traffic, as well as, collect the traffic itself in pcap 
[T] format, all for the purpose of: auditing, historical analysis, and network 
[T] activity discovery. Rules can be used to distinguish normal from abnormal 
[T] traffic and support tagging connections with: rule id, node id, and status id. 
[T] From an intrusion detection standpoint, every connection is an event that 
[T]  must be validated through some means. Sancp uses rules to identify, record, 
[T] and tag traffic of interest.
