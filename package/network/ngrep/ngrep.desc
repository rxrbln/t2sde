[I] A grep for network traffic

[T] ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying
[T] them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow
[T] you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match
[T] against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and
[T] ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces,
[T] and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common
[T] packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
