[I] A bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands

[T] BTPD is a bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands,
[T] which can be used to read and/or manipulate the daemon state. The daemon
[T] is capable of running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one
[T] tcp port. It's fairly low on resource usage and should be perfect for file
[T] distribution sites. Efficient downloads and ease of use makes this client
[T] a good choice for the casual user as well.
