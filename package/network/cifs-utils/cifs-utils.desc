[I] CIFS samba mount and umount utilities (originally were in samba pkg)

[T] The in-kernel CIFS filesystem is generally the preferred method for
[T] mounting SMB/CIFS shares on Linux. The in-kernel CIFS filesystem relies
[T] on a set of user-space tools. That package of tools is called cifs-utils.
[T] Although not really part of Samba proper, these tools were originally part
[T] of the Samba package.
