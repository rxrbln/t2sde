[I] A Web application server for C++

[T] Tntnet is a Web application server for generating Web applications in
[T] C++. HTML pages with some additional tags for inclusion of C++ code are
[T] compiled into shared libraries and served from tntnet. It resembles PHP,
[T] JSP, or Mason, but the programming language used is C++, and the pages are
[T] compiled into native code before serving. Tntnet is fully multithreaded
[T] and supports HTTP keep-alive for best performance. Its dynamic pages
[T] are faster than static pages with other Web servers, while creating Web
[T] applications is simple.
