[I] A threadsafe RTP stack for use with Common C++

[T] Common C++ RTP is an experimental threadsafe RTP stack for use with
[T] Common C++. It uses a service thread to both schedule outgoing packets
[T] and organize arriving packets. Queued lists of packets are maintained
[T] both for sending and receiving, and packet payloads can be mixed such
[T] as for passing RTP telephony events. Recent builds of GNU ccRTP are also
[T] available for building handheld softphone clients using Open Embedded.
