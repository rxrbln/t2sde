[I] An eDonkey p2p client

[T] mldonkey is a new client to access the eDonkey network, a peer-to-peer
[T] network particularly efficient for big files thanks to a multi-sources
[T] download protocol. It is written in Objective-Caml, and comes with its
[T] own GTK GUI, an HTTP interface and a telnet interface. It works on most
[T] UNIX platforms.
