[I] A ncurses IRC-Client

[T] Irssi is a modular IRC client for UNIX that currently has only text mode
[T] user interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific, so
[T] other UIs could be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't really even
[T] IRC specific anymore, there's already working SILC and ICB modules
[T] available. Support for other protocols like ICQ and Jabber could be
[T] created some day too.
