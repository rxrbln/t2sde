[I] A TCP flow recorder

[T] tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
[T] connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
[T] for protocol analysis or debugging. tcpflow understands TCP sequence
[T] numbers and will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of
[T] retransmissions or out-of-order delivery. Each stream is stored
[T] in a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow is designed to be
[T] portable, using the LBL packet capture library and GNU autoconf. It
[T] works under most UNIX platforms and for most common network interface
[T] types (ethernet, PPP, loopback, etc.).
