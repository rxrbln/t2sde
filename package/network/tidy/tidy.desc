[I] HTML validator and cleaner

[T] HTML TIDY is a free utility to fix mistakes made while editing HTML and to 
[T] automatically tidy up sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup. It also works 
[T] great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized HTML editors 
[T] and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you need to pay further 
[T] attention on making your pages more accessible to people with disabilities.
