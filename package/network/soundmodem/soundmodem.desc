[I] Allows a standard PC soundcard to be used as a packet radio "modem"

[T] This software allows a standard PC soundcard to be used as a packet
[T] radio "modem". The whole processing is done on the main processor CPU.
[T] Unlike previous packet radio modem software, this new release offers several
[T] new benefits:
[T] * Now uses standard operating system sound drivers (OSS/Free under Linux,
[T] /dev/audio under Solaris and DirectSound under Windows), thus runs on all
[T] soundcards for which drivers for the desired operating system are available.
[T] * No fixed relationship between bitrate, sampling rate, and modem parameters.
[T] Modems may be parametrized, and multiple modems may even run on the same
[T] audio channel!
[T] * Usermode solution allows the use of MMX, VIS, Floating point and other
[T] media instruction sets to speed up computation.
[T] * Cross platform builds from a single source code provides ubiquitous
[T] availability.
