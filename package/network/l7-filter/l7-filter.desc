[I] Application Layer Packet Classifier for Linux

[T] This is a classifier for the Linux kernel's Netfilter subsystem that
[T] identifies packets based on application layer data (OSI layer 7).
[T] This means that it can classify packets as HTTP, FTP, Gnucleus,
[T] eDonkey2000, etc, regardless of port. Our classifier complements
[T] existing ones that match on address, port numbers and so on.
[T]
[T] Our intent is for l7-filter to be used in conjunction with Linux QoS
[T] to do bandwith arbitration ("packet shaping").
