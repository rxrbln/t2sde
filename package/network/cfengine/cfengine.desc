[I] A tool for administering Networks of Diverse Machines

[T] Cfengine is a tool for setting up and maintaining BSD and System-5-like
[T] operating system optionally attached to a TCP/IP network. You can think
[T] of cfengine as a very high level language, much higher level than Perl
[T] or shell: a single statement can result in many hundreds of operations
[T] being performed on multiple hosts. Cfengine is good at performing a lot
[T] of common system administration tasks, and allows you to build on its
[T] strengths with your own scripts. You can also use it as a netwide
[T] front-end for `cron'.
