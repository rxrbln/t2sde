[I] A network Audit Record Generation and Utilization System

[T] Argus is a fixed-model Real Time Flow Monitor designed to track and
[T] report on the status and performance of all network transactions seen
[T] in a data network traffic stream. Argus provides a common data format
[T] for reporting flow metrics such as connectivity, capacity, demand,
[T] loss, delay, and jitter on a per transaction basis. The record format that
[T] Argus uses is flexible and extensible, supporting generic flow identifiers
[T] and metrics, as well as application/protocol specific information.
