[I] A tiny CGI interpreter using PHP-like syntax for shell scripts

[T] Haserl is a small CGI program that parses POST and GET data from
[T] Web clients and provides a PHP-like syntax for writing dynamic Web
[T] content. A Unix shell is used for the scripting language. It is intended
[T] for environments where something like PHP is too big, and compiles to
[T] around 20KB.
