[I] A secure, extremely fast and stable FTP server

[T] vsftpd is a GPL licensed FTP server for UNIX systems, including Linux.
[T] It is secure and extremely fast. It is stable.
[T] The only reason you might prefer a different FTP server to vsftpd is
[T] if you really need the configurability of one of the more bloated FTP
[T] servers. Having said this, note that vsftpd caters for the vast
[T] majority of use cases. Even if vsftpd appears to be missing a feature,
[T] it is often satisfied by an external component such as PAM or xinetd /
[T] tcp_wrappers. In this regard, vsftpd is being a small modular
[T] component in the proper spirit of UNIX. Finally, consider moving to
[T] vsftpd even if it means sacrificing some whacky feature of your
[T] current FTP server. The security, performance and stability gains are
[T] waiting for you.
