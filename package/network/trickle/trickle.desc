[I] A portable lightweight userspace bandwidth shaper

[T] trickle is a portable lightweight userspace bandwidth shaper. It can run 
[T] in collaborative mode (together with trickled) or in stand alone mode.
[T] trickle works by taking advantage of the unix loader preloading. 
[T] Essentially it provides, to the application, a new version of the 
[T] functionality that is required to send and receive data through sockets. 
[T] It then limits traffic based on delaying the sending and receiving of data 
[T] over a socket. trickle runs entirely in userspace and does not require root 
[T] privileges.
