[I] A Zeroconf mDNS/DNS-SD responder

[T] Avahi is a framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery
[T] (mDNS/DNS-SD a.k.a. Zeroconf) on Linux. It allows programs
[T] to publish and discover services running on a local network
[T] with no specific configuration. For example, you can plug
[T] into a network and instantly find printers to print to, files
[T] to look at, and people to talk to.
