[I] A Web filter with multiple page content analysis mechanisms

[T] DansGuardian is a Web content filtering proxy that uses Squid to do all
[T] the fetching. It filters using multiple methods including, but not
[T] limited to, phrase matching, file extension matching, MIME type
[T] matching, PICS filtering, and URL/domain blocking. It has the ability to
[T] switch off filtering by certain criteria including username, domain
[T] name, source IP, etc. The configurable logging produces a log in an easy
[T] to read format. It has the option to only log text-based pages, thus
[T] significantly reducing redundant information (such as every image on a
[T] page).
