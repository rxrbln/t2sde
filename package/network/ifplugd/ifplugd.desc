[I] A daemon to automatically configure a ethernet device on state change

[T] ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure your
[T] ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and automatically unconfigure
[T] it if the cable is pulled. This is useful on laptops with onboard network
[T] adapters, since it will only configure the interface when a cable is
[T] really connected.
