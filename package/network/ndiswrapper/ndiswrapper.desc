[I] NDIS wrapper for Linux

[T] NDIS wrapper implements Windows kernel API and NDIS (Network Driver
[T] Interface Specification) API within the Linux kernel. A Windows driver
[T] for wireless network card is then linked to this implementation so
[T] that the driver runs natively, as though it is in Windows, without
[T] binary emulation.
