[I] A network protocol analyzer

[T] Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It
[T] allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file
[T] on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary
[T] and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has several powerful
[T] features, including a rich display filter language and the ability to view
[T] the reconstructed stream of a TCP session. (Formerly known as Ethereal.)
