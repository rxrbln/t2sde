[I] A versatile and fast packet generator

[T] Mausezahn is a fast traffic generator which allows you to send nearly
[T] every possible and impossible packet. Mausezahn can be used, for example,
[T] as a traffic generator to stress multicast networks, for penetration
[T] testing of firewalls and IDS, for simulating DoS attacks on networks,
[T] to find bugs in network software or appliances, for reconnaissance
[T] attacks using ping sweeps and port scans, or to test network behavior
[T] under strange circumstances. Mausezahn gives you full control over the
[T] network interface card and allows you to send any byte stream you want
[T] (even violating Ethernet rules).
