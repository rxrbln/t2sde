[I] NIS (YP) clients

[T] yp-tools is an implementation of the NIS client tools for Linux and should
[T] work with every Linux C Library. This implementation only provides NIS
[T] client tools. You must already have a ypbind daemon running on the same
[T] host, and a NIS server running somewhere in the net.
