[I] A libpcap, NetFlow, and sFlow IPv4/IPv6 accounting package

[T] Pmacct is a small set of passive network monitoring tools to measure,
[T] account, classify, aggregate, and export IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A
[T] pluggable and flexible architecture allows collected network data to be
[T] stored into memory tables or SQL (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) databases and
[T] exported through NetFlow or sFlow protocols to remote collectors. Pmacct
[T] supports fully customizable historical data breakdown, flow sampling,
[T] filtering and tagging, recovery actions, and triggers. Libpcap, sFlow
[T] v2/v4/v5 and NetFlow v1/v5/v7/v8/v9 are supported.
