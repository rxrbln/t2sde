[I] A lightweight, caching DNS proxy with integrated DHCP server

[T] Dnsmasq is a caching DNS forwarder designed to provide DNS service on
[T] a small network. It is targeted at home networks using NAT and connected
[T] to the internet via a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection but would be
[T] a good choice for any small network where low resource use and ease of
[T] configuration are important.
