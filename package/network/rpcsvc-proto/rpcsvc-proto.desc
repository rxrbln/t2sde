[I] RPC headers previously in glibc

[T] This package contains rpcsvc proto.x files from glibc, which are
[T] missing in libtirpc. Additional it contains rpcgen, which is needed
[T] to create header files and sources from protocol files.
[T] This package is only needed, if glibc is installed without the
[T] deprecated sunrpc functionality and libtirpc should replace it.
