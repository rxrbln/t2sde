[I] Matt's TraceRoute

[T] Mtr combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs in a
[T] single network diagnostic tool. It has a curses and a gtk+ based interface.
[T]
[T] As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
[T] mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it
[T] determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
[T] it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
[T] quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints
[T] running statistics about each machine.
