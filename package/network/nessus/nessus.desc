[I] A security scanner

[T] The "Nessus" Project aims to provide to the Internet community a free,
[T] powerful, up-to-date and easy to use remote security scanner.
[T]
[T] A security scanner is a software which will audit remotely a given network
[T] and determine whether bad guys (aka 'crackers') may break into it, or 
[T] misuse it in some way.
[T]
[T] Unlike many other security scanners, Nessus does not take anything for 
[T] granted. That is, it will not consider that a given service is running on
[T] a fixed port - that is, if you run your web server on port 1234, Nessus 
[T] will detect it and test its security. It will not make its security tests
[T] regarding the version number of the remote services, but will really 
[T] attempt to exploit the vulnerability.
[T]
[T] Nessus is very fast, reliable and has a modular architecture that allows 
[T] you to fit it to your needs.
