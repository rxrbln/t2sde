[T] Twisted is an event-based framework for Internet applications. It includes
[T] a Web server, an SMTP/POP3 server, a telnet server, an SSH server, an

[T] access (Perspective Broker), and APIs for creating new protocols. It
[T] supports integration with GTK+, GTK+ 2, Qt, Tkinter, wxPython, Mac OS X
[T] (PyObjC) and Win32 event loops. It also supports TCP, SSL and TLS, UDP,
[T] Unix sockets, multicast, and serial ports. Supported protocols include
