[I] Advanced, incredibly configurable and secure FTP daemon

[T] ProFTPD is a proven, high-performance, scalable FTP server written
[T] from scratch, with a focus toward simplicity, security, and ease of
[T] configuration. Naturally, ProFTPD powers some of the largest sites on the
[T] Internet. It features a very Apache-like configuration syntax, modules,
[T] and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
[T] multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based
[T] directory visibility.
