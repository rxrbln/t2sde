[I] Declaratively deploy your Kubernetes manifests

[T] Helmfile is a declarative spec for deploying helm charts. It lets you:
[T] 
[T] - Keep a directory of chart value files and maintain changes in version control.
[T] - Apply CI/CD to configuration changes.
[T] - Periodically sync to avoid skew in environments.
[T] 
[T] To avoid upgrades for each iteration of helm, the helmfile executable
[T] delegates to helm - as a result, helm must be installed.
