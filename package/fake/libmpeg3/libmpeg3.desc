[I] Libmpeg3 supports advanced editing and manipulation of MPEG streams

[T] MPEG is normally a last mile distribution format but with libmpeg3 you 
[T] can edit it like a production format. Unless you have a need for MPEG 
[T] editing and copying, you're better off using a library like FFMPEG.
[T]
[T] Libmpeg3 is primarily a supporting library for Cinelerra. It supports 
[T] all of the nonstandard operations Cinelerra needs. Libmpeg3 provides a 
[T] uniform front end for a large number of the MPEG formats used in HDTV 
[T] broadcasting. It decodes
[T]
[T]    MPEG-1 Layer II Audio
[T]    MPEG-1 Layer III Audio
[T]    MPEG-2 Layer III Audio
[T]    MPEG-1 program streams
[T]    MPEG-2 program streams
[T]    MPEG-2 transport streams
[T]    AC3 Audio
[T]    MPEG-2 Video
[T]    MPEG-1 Video
[T]    IFO files
[T]    VOB files
[T]
[T] Now the good news. It can read the MPEG exports from Cinelerra.
[T]  
[T] A table of contents feature allows it to seek with frame accuracy 
[T] regardless of whether the footage has timecode or not, or whether the 
[T] timecode is contiguous. Also included are utilities for stream extraction, 
[T] format querying, and copying.
