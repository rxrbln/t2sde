[I] ROCr a HPC market enhanced HSA based runtime

[T] This ROCm Runtime (ROCr) repo combines 2 previously separate repos into a
[T] single repo: - The HSA Runtime (hsa-runtime) for AMD GPU application
[T] development and - The ROCt Thunk Library (libhsakmt), a "thunk" interface
[T] to the ROCm kernel driver (ROCk), used by the runtime. The HSA runtime is a
[T] thin, user-mode API that exposes the necessary interfaces to access and
[T] interact with graphics hardware driven by the AMDGPU driver set and the
[T] ROCK kernel driver.
