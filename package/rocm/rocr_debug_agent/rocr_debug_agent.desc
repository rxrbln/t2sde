[I] AMD ROCm Debug Agent Library (ROCdebug-agent)

[T] The AMD ROCm Debug Agent (ROCdebug-agent) is a library that can be loaded
[T] by the ROCm Platform Runtime (ROCr) to provide the following functionality:
[T] - Print the state of all AMD GPU wavefronts that caused a queue error (for
[T] example, causing a memory violation, executing an "s_trap 2", or executing
[T] an illegal instruction). - Print the state of all AMD GPU wavefronts by
[T] sending a SIGQUIT signal to the process (for example, by pressing "Ctrl-\")
[T] while the program is executing.
