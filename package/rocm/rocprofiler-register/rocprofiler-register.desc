[I] A helper library to intercept API table(s) of the HSA/HIP/ROCTx runtime

[T] The rocprofiler-register library is a helper library that coordinates the
[T] modification of the intercept API table(s) of the HSA/HIP/ROCTx runtime
[T] libraries by the ROCprofiler (v2) library. The purpose of this library is
[T] to provide a consistent and automated mechanism of enabling performance
[T] analysis in the ROCm runtimes which does not rely on environment variables
[T] or unique methods for each runtime library.
