[I] cthumb allows you to create themable web picture albums

[T] Create themable web picture albums, i.e. collections of digital
[T] pictures, with small thumbnails of your pictures and with captions. In
[T] addition, it optionally allows you to have several views of the
[T] collection of pictures. An album is composed of a series of pages, each
[T] composed of a collection of pictures. For each page (and each picture),
[T] you can have several annotations per picture. cthumb  will generate
[T] several versions of the page, for each annotation type.
