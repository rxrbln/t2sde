[I] ser2net provides a proxy that allows telnet/tcp connections to serial ports on a machine.

[T]  ser2net provides a way for a user to connect from a network connection
[T] to a serial port.  I tried all the other ones I could find and found them
[T] lacking, so I wrote my own.  It provides all the serial port setup, a
[T] configuration file to configure the ports, a control login for modifying
[T] port parameters, monitoring ports, and controlling ports.
