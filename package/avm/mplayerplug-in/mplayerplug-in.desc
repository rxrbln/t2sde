[I] mplayerplug-in is a browser plugin that uses mplayer to play digital media from websites.

[T] This plugin gives Netscape, Opera, Mozilla and Konqueror the ability to
[T] play videos off the net without reading the source html and getting the url
[T] manually. Videos are played embedded in the page or in a separate window
[T] depending on how the author of the webpage intended the media to be seen.
