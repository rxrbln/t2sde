[I] fwbuilder - a firewall builder

[T] Firewall Builder consists of a GUI and set of policy compilers for
[T] various firewall platforms. It helps users maintain a database of objects
[T] and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop operations. The GUI
[T] and policy compilers are completely independent, and support for a new
[T] firewall platform can be added to the GUI without any changes to the
[T] program (only a new policy compiler is needed). This provides for a
[T] consistent abstract model and the same GUI for different firewall
[T] platforms. It currently supports iptables, ipfilter, and OpenBSD pf.
