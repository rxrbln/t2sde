[I] VDR Plugin: text2skin

[T] Video Disc Recorder plugin: text2skin
[T] This plugin is designed to load and interpret a set of files describing the
[T] layout of the On Screen Display and to make this "Skin" available to VDR via
[T] Setup -> OSD in the main menu. Of course it is possible to load more than one
[T] text-based skin this way and to choose between them while running VDR. All
[T] skins may be themeable (you can create your own color-theme) and translateable
[T] as the author of the skin wishes.
