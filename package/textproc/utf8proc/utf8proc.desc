[I] UTF-8 library

[T] Utf8proc is a library for processing UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings. Some
[T] features are Unicode normalization, stripping of default ignorable
[T] characters, case folding, and detection of grapheme cluster
[T] boundaries. The library can be used in C programs, but most of the
[T] functionality is also available as a ruby library. For PostgreSQL,
[T] there is an extension providing a function for preparing strings in case
[T] insensitive indices. The currently supported Unicode version is 5. 0. 0.
