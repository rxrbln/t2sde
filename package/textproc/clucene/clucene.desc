[I] A high-performance, full-featured text search engine

[T] CLucene is a high-performance, scalable, cross platform,
[T] full-featured, open-source indexing and searching API. It
[T] is written in C++.
[T] CLucene is a port of the very popular Java Lucene text search
[T] engine API. Specifically, CLucene is the guts of a search
[T] engine, the hard stuff. You write the easy stuff, the UI
[T] and the process of selecting and parsing your data files
[T] to pump them into the search engine yourself.
[T] CLucene aims to be a good alternative to Java Lucene when
[T] performance really matters or if you want to stick to good
[T] old C++.
