# TODO: this is a quickhack to have a working docbook installation to fix many packages which depend on it.
#       the whole installation of the docbook xml-dtds and xslts should be reworked.
#       best would be to define (or find out) how a standard docbook and xml-catalog installation should look
#       like and the registration in the system catalog should be done in a postinstall script
#       (other packages may also install dtds, xslts which should be registered)
#       after this is done, it will be possible to put every docbook version and xslt and others into
#       their own package.
# TODO: honor prefix
