[I] A simple but flexible container object

[T] The Element type is a simple but flexible container object, designed to
[T] store hierarchical data structures, such as simplified XML infosets, in
[T] memory. The element type can be described as a cross between a Python
[T] list and a Python dictionary.
[T]
[T] The Element type is available as a pure-Python implementation for Python
[T] 1.5.2 and later.
