[I] A sophisticated and flexible sort utility

[T] Msort sorts files in sophisticated ways. Records may be fixed size,
[T] newline-separated blocks, or terminated by any specified character. Key
[T] fields may be selected by position, tag, or character range. For
[T] each key, distinct exclusions, multigraphs, substitutions, and a sort
[T] order may be defined or locale collation rules used. Comparisons may be
[T] lexicographic, numeric, numeric string, hybrid, random, by string length,
[T] angle, domain name, date, time, month name, or ISO8601 timestamp. Keys
[T] may be reversed so as to generate reverse dictionaries. Optional keys
[T] are supported. Unicode is supported, including full case-folding. Msort
[T] itself has a somewhat complex command line interface, but may be driven
[T] by an optional GUI.
