[I] a simple Python based template language for XML vocabularies

[T] Kid is a simple Python based template language for XML vocabularies.
[T] It was spawned as a result of a kinky love triangle between XSLT, TAL,
[T] and PHP. We believe many of the best features of these languages live
[T] on in Kid with much of the limitations and complexity stamped out.
