[I] A LaTeX to HTML converter

[T] TeX4ht is a convertor that converts TEX and LATEX documents to HTML (and
[T] some other formats). This way e.g. scientific papers - primarily typeset
[T] for printing - can be put on the Web for online viewing. In contrast to
[T] LATEX2HTML TeX4ht does not try to reimplement the TeX layout, but used
[T] the usual TeX engine and does the postprecessing.
