[I] A grep-like tool for searching text files

[T] Glark offers grep-like searching of text files, with very
[T] powerful, complex regular expressions. It also  highlights the
[T] matches, displays context (preceding and succeeding lines),
[T] does case-insensitive matches, and automatic exclusion of non-text
[T] files. It supports most options from the GNU version of grep.
