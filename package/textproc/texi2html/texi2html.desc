[I] Texinfo to HTML Conversion Script

[T] Texi2HTML is a Perl script which converts Texinfo source files to HTML
[T] output.
[T]
[T] This is an evolving version of the script originally developed by Lionel
[T] Cons and later maintained for a time by Olaf Bachmann. It now supports
[T] many advanced features, such as internationalization and extremely
[T] configurable output formats. It is still in development despite the fact
[T] that GNU makeinfo now supports HTML output because it still supports many
[T] features beyond those supported by makeinfo.
