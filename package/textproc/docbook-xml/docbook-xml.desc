[I] XML scheme for documentation

[T] DocBook is a widely used XML scheme for writing documentation and help.
[T] It has a very rich markup which allows you to use XSL stylesheets to
[T] produce various target formats such as HTML, PostScript, PDF, RTF, and
[T] HTMLHelp. ScrollKeeper was designed with an emphasis on DocBook, since
[T] it has the richest markup of all commonly used documentation formats
[T] which allows ScrollKeeper to extract the most useful information from
[T] the document itself.
[T]
[T] The DocBook DTD and stylesheets are typically distributed in packages
[T] which lack installation scripts. In the past, installation was simple
[T] enough that users could easily just copy the files into place. Now that
[T] modern XML libraries, such as libxml, support XML catalogs, correct
[T] installation of DTD's and stylesheets require proper catalog
[T] registration.

# TODO: this is a quickhack to have a working docbook installation to fix many packages which depend on it.
#       the whole installation of the docbook xml-dtds and xslts should be reworked.
#       best would be to define (or find out) how a standard docbook and xml-catalog installation should look
#       like and the registration in the system catalog should be done in a postinstall script
#       (other packages may also install dtds, xslts which should be registered)
#       after this is done, it will be possible to put every docbook version and xslt and others into
#       their own package.
# TODO: honor prefix
