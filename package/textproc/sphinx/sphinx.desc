[I] A full-text search engine

[T] Sphinx is a full-text search engine. It's a standalone search engine,
[T] meant to provide fast, size-efficient and relevant fulltext search
[T] functions to other applications. Sphinx was specially designed to
[T] integrate well with SQL databases and scripting languages. Currently
[T] built-in data sources support fetching data either via direct connection
[T] to MySQL or PostgreSQL, or using XML pipe mechanism (a pipe to indexer
[T] in special XML-based format which Sphinx recognizes).
