[I] A C++ XML parser

[T] Xerces C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
[T] C++. It makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and
[T] write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing, generating,
[T] manipulating, and validating XML documents. It is faithful to the XML
[T] 1. 0 recommendation and associated standards ( DOM 1. 0, DOM 2. 0. SAX
[T] 1. 0, SAX 2. 0, Namespaces). It also provides an implementation of a
[T] subset of the Schema.
