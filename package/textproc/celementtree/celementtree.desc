[I] A C implementation of the ElementTree API

[T] The cElementTree module is a C implementation of the ElementTree API.
[T] On typical documents, it's 15-20 times faster than the Python version
[T] of ElementTree, and uses 2-5 times less memory. On modern hardware,
[T] that means that documents in the 50-100 megabyte range can be
[T] manipulated in memory, and that documents in the 0-1 megabyte
[T] range load in zero time (0.0 seconds). This allows you to
[T] drastically simplify many kinds of XML applications.
