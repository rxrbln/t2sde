[I] A configuration file parser library

[T] LibConfuse is a configuration file parser library written
[T] in C. It's goal is to be easy to use and quick to integrate
[T] into existing code. It supports sections and (lists of) values
[T] (strings, integers, floats, booleans, or other sections), as
[T] well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted
[T] strings, environment variable expansion, functions, and nested
[T] include statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration
[T] file capability to a program using a simple API.
