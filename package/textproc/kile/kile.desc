[I] An integrated LaTeX environment

[T] The aim of the Kile project is to develop a user friendly TeX/LaTeX editor.
[T] It will run on systems with the KDE desktop environment. 
[T] Kile is also part of the Fink project, which means you can run Kile even on
[T] a Mac with OS-X! 
[T] The main features are:
[T] Compile, convert and view your document with one click.
[T] Templates and wizards makes starting a new document very little work.
[T] Easy insertion of many standard tags and symbols and the option to define
[T] (an arbitrary number of) user defined tags.
[T] Inverse and forward search: click in the DVI viewer and jump to the 
[T] corresponding LaTeX line in the editor, or jump from the editor to the
[T] corresponding page in the viewer.
[T] Finding chapter or sections is very easy, Kile constructs a list of all the
[T] chapter etc. in your document. You can use the list to jump to the 
[T] corresponding section.
[T] Collect documents that belong together into a project.
