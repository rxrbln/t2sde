[I] The Enlightenment File System Daemon

[T] Efsd, the Enlightenment File System Daemon, is a daemon that provides
[T] commonly needed file system functionality to one or more clients. It
[T] comes as a library that clients (like e17) use, sending commands to
[T] the daemon, which asynchronously reports back the outcome of the
[T] commands when their execution is finished. Efsd therefore decouples
[T] the client 100% from any file system related tasks (which means that
[T] you will for example not see a GUI application hang, assuming it is
[T] coded sanely),
