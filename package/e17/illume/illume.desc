[I] Enlightenmant application and layout manager

[T] Illume is a module for Enlightenment that modifies the user interface
[T] of enlightenment to work cleanly and nicely on a mobile device.
[T] It combines an application launcher interface along with an application
[T] manager and switcher, as well as forcing certain simple layout policies
[T] on applications (such as making their main windows borderless and
[T] fullscreen except for Illume's control bar).
