[I] A complex graphical design & layout library

[T] Edje should serve all the purposes of creating visual elements (borders
[T] of windows, scrollbars, etc.) and allow the designer the ability to
[T] animate, layout and control the look and feel of any program using Edje
[T] as its basic GUI constructor. This library allows for multiple collections
[T] of Layouts in one file, sharing the same image database and thus allowing
[T] a whole theme to be conveneintly packaged into 1 file and shipped around.
