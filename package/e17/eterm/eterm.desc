[I] An X11 VT102 emulator with Enlightenment features

[T] Eterm is a vt102 terminal emulator intended as a replacement for
[T] xterm. It is designed with a Freedom of Choice philosophy, leaving
[T] as much power, flexibility, and freedom as possible in the hands
[T] of the user. It is designed to look good and work well, but takes a
[T] feature-rich approach rather than one of minimalism. Current features
[T] include color support, background images (all Imlib-supported
[T] formats), theme support, and pseudo-transparency.
