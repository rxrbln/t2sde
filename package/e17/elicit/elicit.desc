[I] A magnifier for examining images on your desktop

[T] Elicit is a tool for examining images on your desktop, providing both
[T] a global color picker and a zoom tool. Graphic artists and designers
[T] can quickly examine graphics without needed to rely on larger tools
[T] such as GIMP for simple examinations and color checks. Elicit is
[T] especially useful for theme development and spot checking.
