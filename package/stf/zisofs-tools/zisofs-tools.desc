[I] Tools for ISO filesystems with transparent compression

[T] The user tools for zisofs come in two parts: a utility "mkzftree" and
[T] a modification to mkisofs, which is part of the cdrtools package.  The
[T] mkisofs change has been integrated in the cdrtools distribution as of
[T] cdrtools-1.11a20; a patch for cdrtools-1.11a09 which is also tested
[T] and working on cdrtools-1.10 is included with this package if you
[T] insist on running an older version.
