[I] Debug Malloc Library

[T] The debug memory allocation or dmalloc library has been designed as a drop in
[T] replacement for the system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free and other memory
[T] management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities configurable
[T] at runtime. These facilities include such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-
[T] post write detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging of
[T] statistics.
