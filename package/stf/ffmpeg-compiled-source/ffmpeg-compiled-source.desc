[I] A complete solution to record, convert and stream audio and video

[T] It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec library. FFmpeg is
[T] developed under Linux, but it compiles under most OSes, including Windows.
[T] The project is made of several components:
[T] + ffmpeg is a command line tool to convert one video file format to another.
[T] It also supports grabbing and encoding in real time from a TV card.
[T] + ffserver is an HTTP (RTSP is being developped) multimedia streaming server
[T] for live broadcasts. Time shifting of live broadcast is also supported.
[T] + libavcodec is a library containing all the ffmpeg audio/video encoders and
[T] decoders. Most codecs were developed from scratch to ensure best
[T] performances and high code reusability.
[T] + libavformat is a library containing parsers and generators for all common
[T] audio/video formats.
[T] This package only provides the compiled sources used to compile the avview
[T] package. Choose the ffmpeg package for the real application.
