[I] A complex graphical design & layout library

[T] Edje should serve all the purposes of creating visual elements, like
[T] Shockwave / FLASH and more (borders of windows, scrollbars, etc.) and
[T] allow the designer the ability to animate, layout and control the look
[T] and feel of any program using Edje as its basic GUI constructor.
[T] This library allows for multiple collections of Layouts in one file,
[T] sharing the same image database and thus allowing a whole theme to be
[T] conveneintly packaged into 1 file and shipped around.
