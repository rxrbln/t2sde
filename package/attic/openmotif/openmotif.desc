[I] Open Motif implementation

[T] Motif is the industry standard graphical user interface (GUI) available on
[T] more than 200 hardware and software platforms. It is the de facto graphical
[T] user interface on UNIX systems in heterogeneous networked computing
[T] environments. Motif is fully specified by the IEEE 1295 standard, providing
[T] application developers, system vendors, and end users with a stable, mature
[T] and reliable environment for application presentation on a wide range of
[T] platforms. Motif is also the base graphical user interface for the Common
[T] Desktop Environment (CDE) and a number of other desktops.
