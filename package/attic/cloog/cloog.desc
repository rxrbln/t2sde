[I] Code Generator in the Polyhedral Model's Home

[T] CLooG-PPL is a library to generate code for scanning
[T] Z-polyhedra. In other words, it finds code that reaches
[T] each integral point of one or more parameterized polyhedra.
[T] GCC links with this library in order to enable the new loop
[T] generation code known as Graphite.
