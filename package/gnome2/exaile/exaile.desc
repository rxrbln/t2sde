[I] A media player aiming to have a simple interface yet many features

[T] Exaile is a media player aiming to be similar to KDE's AmaroK, but
[T] for GTK+. It incorporates many of the features from AmaroK (and other
[T] media players) like automatic fetching of album art, handling of large
[T] libraries, lyrics fetching, artist/album information via the wikipedia,
[T] last. Fm support, and optional iPod support (assuming you have python-gpod
[T] installed). In addition, it includes a built in shoutcast directory
[T] browser, tabbed playlists (so you can have more than one playlist open
[T] at a time), blacklisting of tracks (so they don't get scanned into
[T] your library), downloading of guitar tablature from fretplay. Com,
[T] and submitting played tracks on your iPod to last. Fm.
