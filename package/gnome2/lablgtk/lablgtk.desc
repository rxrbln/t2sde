[I] An Objective Caml interface to gtk+

[T] It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a strongly
[T] typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to gtk+. This is
[T] not that easy if you know the dynamic typing approach taken by gtk+.
[T] It is still under development, but already fully functional. All widgets
[T] (but one) are available, with almost all their methods. The GLArea
[T] widget is also supported in combination with LablGL. GtkXMHtml, LibGlade
[T] and GdkPixbuf support is also included.
[T] Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel, which
[T] allows for interactive use of the library.
