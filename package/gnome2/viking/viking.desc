[I] A GPS data editor and topo viewer

[T] Viking is a GTK2-based GPS data editor and viewer. It can download and
[T] show Terraserver maps, import and draw tracks and waypoints over them, add
[T] coordinate lines, make new tracks and waypoints, hide different things,
[T] and more. It uses a hierarchical layering system to organize GPS data,
[T] maps, and other layer types with spatial data (such as coordinate lines).
