[I] Window-matching utility for Metacity

[T] A window-matching utility, inspired by Sawfish's "Matched Windows"
[T] option and the lack of the functionality in Metacity. Metacity lacking
[T] window matching is not a bad thing -- Metacity is a lean window
[T] manager, and window manipulation does not have to be a window manager
[T] task.
