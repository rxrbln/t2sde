[I] Speech generation library

[T] GNOME Speech's purpose is to provide a simple general API for producing
[T] text-to-speech output.
[T] The GNOME Speech 1.0 API is currently under development, and it will
[T] provide API for both text-to-speech output as well as speech input.
[T] It will be heavily influenced by the Java Speech API, both the
[T] existing 1.0 specification, and the new 2.0 one which is currently
[T] under development.
