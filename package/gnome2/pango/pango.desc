[I] Library for layout and rendering of internationalized text

[T] The goal of the Pango project is to provide an open-source framework for
[T] the layout and rendering of internationalized text. Pango is an offshoot
[T] of the GTK+ and GNOME projects, and the initial focus is operation in
[T] those environments, however there is nothing fundamentally GTK+ or GNOME
[T] specific about Pango. Pango uses Unicode for all of its encoding, and
[T] will eventually support output in all the worlds major languages.
