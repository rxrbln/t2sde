[I] Advanced architecture for desktop applets

[T] 'gDesklets' provides an advanced architecture for desktop applets - tiny
[T] displays sitting on your desktop in a symbiotic relationship of eye candy and
[T] usefulness.
[T] Populate your desktop with status meters, icon bars, weather sensors,
[T] news tickers... whatever you can imagine! Virtually anything is possible and
[T] maybe even available some day.
