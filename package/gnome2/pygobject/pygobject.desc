[I] The Python bindings for GObject

[T] PyGObject provides a convenient wrapper for the GObject+ library for use
[T] in Python programs, and takes care of many of the boring details such as
[T] managing memory and type casting.  When combined with PyGTK, PyORBit and
[T] gnome-python, it can be used to write full featured Gnome applications.
