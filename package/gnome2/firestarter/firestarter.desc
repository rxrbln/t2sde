[I] Firewall creation/monitoring tool

[T] Firestarter is a firewall tool for Linux, and uses GNOME. You can use
[T] the wizard to create a basic firewall, then streamline it further using
[T] the dynamic rules. You can open and close ports with a few clicks, or
[T] stealth your services giving access only to a select few. It features
[T] a real-time hit monitor which you can watch as attackers probe your
[T] machine for open ports.
