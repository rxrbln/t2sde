[I] An Energy Saving Preference dialog

[T] This is Battfink, an Energy Saving Preference dialog with an associating
[T] battery notification icon. The notification icon takes up considerably less
[T] space than the existing battery applet in the gnome-utils package, and
[T] also currently provides no configuration options.
