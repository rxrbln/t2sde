[I] Tool for memory profiling and leak detection

[T] MemProf is a tool for profiling memory usage and finding memory leaks. It
[T] can generate a profile showing how much memory has been allocated by
[T] each function in a program, and it can scan a program's memory and find
[T] blocks that were allocated but are no longer referenced. MemProf does
[T] not require you to recompile your programs. Unlike some similar tools,
[T] it has has a graphical frontend and is relatively easy to use.
