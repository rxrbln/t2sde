[I] The GStreamer graphical pipeline editor

[T] This is the editor for GStreamer, a framework for streaming media.  The
[T] fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon Graduate
[T] Institute, as well as some ideas from DirectMedia.  It's based on plug-ins
[T] that will provide the various codec and other functionality.  The
[T] interface hopefully is generic enough for various companies (ahem, Apple)
[T] to release binary codecs for Linux, until such time as they get a clue and
[T] release the source.
