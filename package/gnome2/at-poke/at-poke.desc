[I] Tool for poking around with accessibility support in GTK-2

[T] This is a tool for poking around with accessibility support.
[T] 
[T] The good thing about a tool is that you know it works, and you
[T] can use it as a yardstick for whether your code is working.
[T] 
[T] So far at-poke is useless for the above, since it substantially
[T] fails to work in a predictable way, but its getting there.
[T] 
[T] To play with it you need to execute at-poke from at-poke/src,
[T] due to the glade path hard-coding fun.
