[I] Vector drawing widget for GTK+/Gnome

[T] The GNOME canvas is an engine for structured graphics that
[T] offers a rich imaging model, high performance rendering, and a
[T] powerful, high-level API.  It offers a choice of two rendering
[T] back-ends, one based on Xlib for extremely fast display, and
[T] another based on Libart, a sophisticated, antialiased,
[T] alpha-compositing engine.  Applications have a choice between
[T] the Xlib imaging model or a superset of the PostScript imaging
[T] model, depending on the level of graphic sophistication
[T] required.
