[I] Multi-media framework 

[T] GStreamer allows the construction of graphs of media-handling components,
[T] ranging from simple mp3 playback to complex audio (mixing) and video
[T] (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of
[T] advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can
[T] add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean,
[T] generic interface. GStreamer is released under the LGPL, with many of
[T] the included plugins retaining the license of the code they were derived
[T] from, usually GPL or BSD.
