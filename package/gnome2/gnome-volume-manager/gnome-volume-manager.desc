[I] Gnome Volume Manager

[T] gnome-volume-manager is a desktop-level daemon that enforces volume-related
[T] policy in response to events received from HAL.  Its goal is to implement
[T] all functionality as a state-machine in response to asynchronous events
[T] from HAL.
[T] 
[T] It is one component in a larger plan to fully integrate all levels of
[T] the Linux system, from the kernel on up through the desktop and its
[T] applications.
