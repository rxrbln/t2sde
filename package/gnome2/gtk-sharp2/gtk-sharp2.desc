[I] Dot Net language binding for the Gtk+ toolkit v2

[T] Gtk# brings the power and ease of .Net development paradigms to the free
[T] software GUI application development community.  Gtk# provides a C source
[T] parser and C# code generator which can be used to produce .Net assemblies
[T] that bind to GObject based libraries.  Among the libraries currently
[T] wrapped are gtk, gdk, atk, pango, gda, gnomedb, gconf, libgnomecanvas,
[T] libgnomeui, and libglade.
