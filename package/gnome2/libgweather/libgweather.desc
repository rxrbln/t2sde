[I] Library to access weather information from online services for numerous locations

[T] Libgweather is a library to access weather information from online services for numerous locations.
[T] Libgweather isn't supported in the devel platform, which means OS vendors won't guarantee
[T] the API/ABI long-term, but authors of open source apps should feel free to use libgweather
[T] as users can always recompile against a new version.
