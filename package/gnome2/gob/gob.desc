[I] Preprocessor for building GTK+ Object

[T] GTK Object Builder (GOB) is a simple preprocessor for easily creating
[T] GTK objects. It reads a class description file with inline C code and
[T] produces .c and .h object files for you. It allows you to easily use all
[T] of the features of the GTK object system and avoids typos by reducing
[T] the amount of code needed. In general, the amount of code is about the
[T] same as for OO languages such as Java or C++, but you still have to only
[T] use C and you get all the power of the GTK object system.
