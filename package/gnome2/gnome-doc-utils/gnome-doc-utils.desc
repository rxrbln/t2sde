[I] Documentation utilities for the Gnome project

[T] gnome-doc-utils is a collection of documentation utilities for the Gnome
[T] project.  Notably, it contains utilities for building documentation and
[T] all auxiliary files in your source tree, and it contains the DocBook

[T] Gnome 2.8, Yelp will require gnome-doc-utils for the XSLT.
