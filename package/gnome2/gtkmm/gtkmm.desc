[I] The C++ bindings for the Gtk+

[T] This package provides a C++ interface for GTK+ (the Gimp ToolKit) GUI
[T] library.  The interface provides a convenient interface for C++
[T] programmers to create GUIs with GTK+'s flexible object-oriented framework.
[T] Features include type safe callbacks, widgets that are extensible using
[T] inheritance and over 110 classes that can be freely combined to quickly
[T] create complex user interfaces.
