[I] sawfish, a highly configurable window manager for X11

[T] Sawfish is an extensible window manager using a Lisp-based extension 
[T] language. All window decorations are configurable and
[T] all user-interface policy is controlled through the language. Its aim 
[T] is to manage windows in the most flexible and attractive
[T] manner possible. As such it does not implement desktop backgrounds, 
[T] application docks, or other things that may be achieved
[T] through separate applications. Sawmill is mostly GNOME-compliant; 
[T] almost all configuration may be made through a graphical
[T] interface.
