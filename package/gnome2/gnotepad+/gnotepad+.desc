[I] Extremely simple, and feature-rich, HTML/text editor for GTK/GNOME

[T] gnotepad+ is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple HTML/text
[T] editor for systems running X11 and using GTK+/GNOME. It is designed
[T] for as little bloat as possible, while still providing many of the
[T] common features found in a modern GUI-based text editor.
