[I] A simple file manager for GPE

[T] GPE-Filemanager is a simple file manager for GPE. It is able to perform
[T] the basic file operations such as copy, delete and move as well as
[T] launching applications using the MIME-type of files to determine the
[T] correct handler application for a file. It makes use of the DBus services
[T] provided by gpe-bluetooth and gpe-beam to transmit files via Bluetooth
[T] or IrDa.
