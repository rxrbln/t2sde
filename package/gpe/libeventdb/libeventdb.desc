[I] Calendar event data library backend

[T] Libeventdb is a library to store and manipulate calendar (dated) events.
[T] The libeventdb library is used by GPE applications which need to handle
[T] scheduled events. Currently mostly gpe-calendar and gpe-clock, but it
[T] provides a common interface which may be used by other applications as
[T] well.
