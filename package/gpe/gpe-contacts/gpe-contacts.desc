[I] A contact manager

[T] GPE-Contacts is a simple but flexible personbal contacts manager. It
[T] stores contact details such as addresses and is able to categorize them.
[T] It has a very scalable user interface supporting a wide variety of target
[T] devices. GPE-Contacts uses DBUS to connect to service provider applications
[T] (GPE-Beam and GPE-Bluetooth) to provide IrDA (IrOBEX) and Bluetooth
[T] (BtOBEX) support for beaming them in vCard format. The application supports
[T] both plain GTK and the Maemo software environments.
