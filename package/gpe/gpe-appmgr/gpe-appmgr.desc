[I] An application launcher

[T] GPE-APPMGR is the main window of the PDA. It allows to start-up
[T] applications and offers a kind of start-menu. Any application that a
[T] user should be able to access should also be available through the
[T] application manager. Every application has to provide a name and an icon
[T] to be displayed. Applications are sorted into different categories so that
[T] finding them is easier. This is done by using 'tabs', much like those in
[T] dialog boxes in many GUIs.

[T] GPE-Appmgr uses freedesktop.org-style desktop files like known from Gnome
[T] and KDE. It is able to deal with single- and multi instance applications
[T] as well as different screen sizes. The screenshot shows it in a mode used
[T] for devices with screens of 640x480 pixels and above.
