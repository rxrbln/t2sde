[I] Keep track of thing you need to do...

[T] GPE-Todo is a function to provide a pretty simple list of outstanding
[T] tasks. You can assign one or more categories to a task to have flexible
[T] control about the topic all the items belong to. In addition to this each
[T] item can be assigned a priority and a date by which it must be completed.
[T] The application supports both plain GTK and the Maemo software environments.
