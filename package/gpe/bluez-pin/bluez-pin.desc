[I] A bluetooth PIN manager

[T] Bluez-Pin is a very simple program which takes care of the PIN numbers
[T] used to pair Bluetooth devices. When a PIN is required for either an 
[T] incoming or outgoing connection, it pops up a window to allow the code
[T] to be entered. PINs can optionally be saved in a persistent database,
[T] for use with dumb devices (e.g. my Nokia 6210) that are unable to remember
[T] pairing information across sessions.
