[I] Shows current harddisk temperature

[T] hddtemp is a small utility that gives you the temperature of your hard
[T] drive by reading S.M.A.R.T. informations (for drives that support this
[T] feature).
[T] Note: only recent hard drives have a temperature sensor.
[T] 
[T] The temperature information seems to be vendor specific (i.e. not
[T] standardized). So hddtemp comes with a file (hddtemp.db)
[T] that contains informations about drives that were reported to
[T] work with hddtemp.
