[I] Apache web server

[T] Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April
[T] of 1996. The May 2002 Netcraft Web Server Survey found that 56% of the
[T] web sites on the Internet are using Apache, thus making it more widely
[T] used than all other web servers combined.
[T]
[T] The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
[T] open-source HTTP server for various modern desktop and server operating
[T] systems, such as UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to
[T] provide a secure, efficient and extensible server which provides HTTP
[T] services in sync with the current HTTP standards.
