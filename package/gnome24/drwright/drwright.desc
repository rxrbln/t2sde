[I] Program that forces regular breaks.

[T] DrWright is a program that forces you to take regular breaks from your
[T] computer. If you like whistles, bells, and a thousand options, this is
[T] not for you. Feel free to check out xwrits instead.  DrWright monitors
[T] keyboard and mouse activity and displays a small meter in the notification
[T] area on your panel. When it starts blinking, you know it's time to take a
[T] break. If you don't, it will lock your screen to force a break.
