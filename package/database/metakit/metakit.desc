[I] The database that fits in the palm of your hand

[T] Metakit is an efficient embedded database library with a small
[T] footprint. It fills the gap between flat-file, relational,
[T] object-oriented, and tree-structured databases, supporting relational
[T] joins, serialization, nested structures, and instant schema evolution.
[T] There is a C++ API, a Python binding called "Mk4py", and a Tcl binding
[T] called "Mk4tcl". You can manipulate and exchange data with any of
[T] these. Data files are portable, use auto-sizing ints and strings,
[T] and have the ability to very efficiently store binary data, from single
[T] bits to multi-Mb objects. The library has been used on Unix, Windows,
[T] Macintosh, VMS, and others, spanning a range of 16- to 64-bit
[T] architectures, from PDA to S390. Here's an ancient sales blurb and a
[T] pretty dated introduction. This library is in active use in various
[T] commercial projects and products.
[T]
[T] Metakit works really well for moderate-size (a hundred Mb) datasets,
[T] and offers good performance well beyond that size when its column-wise
[T] data model is fully taken advantage of. But it's still not as scalable
[T] as it could be, nor does it offer true concurrent access.
