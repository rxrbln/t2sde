[I] A unified database API and C library

[T] The OpenDBX library provides a unified and consistent API for software
[T] developers to different database management systems. The function library
[T] is written in the C programming language and aims at implementing access
[T] to the native database interfaces efficiently via a thin abstraction
[T] layer. It consists of a basic set of functions that are part of all
[T] vendor database libraries and can be extended by additional function
[T] blocks. Currently, Firebird/Interbase, MS SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle
[T] PostgreSQL, SQLite 2 and 3, and Sybase ASE are supported.
