[I] A C++ wrapper for MySQL

[T] MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL's C API. It is built around
[T] the same principles as the Standard C++ Library, to make dealing
[T] with the database as easy as dealing with STL containers. In
[T] addition, MySQL++ provides facilities that let you avoid the
[T] most repetitive sorts of SQL within your own code, providing
[T] native C++ interfaces for these common tasks
