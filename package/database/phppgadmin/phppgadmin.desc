[I] A PHP-based PostgreSQL administration utility

[T] phpPgAdmin is a fully functional PHP-based administration package for
[T] PostgreSQL. It has all the basic functionality you need to completely
[T] administer a PosgreSQL server and/or database, including the ability to
[T] administer views, sequences, stored procedures, and triggers. Features
[T] include the ability to create and drop databases; create, copy, drop, and
[T] alter tables/views/sequences/functions/triggers; edit and add fields (to
[T] the extent Postgres allows); execute any SQL-statement, even
[T] batch-queries; manage keys on fields; create and read dumps of database
[T] and tables; and administer one single database, multiple servers, and
[T] Postgres users/groups.
