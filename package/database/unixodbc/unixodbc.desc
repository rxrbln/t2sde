[I] The definitive standard for ODBC on non MS Windows platforms

[T] The unixODBC project provides Unix applications with the same ODBC 3.51
[T] API and facilities available under Windows. It provides a Driver Manager
[T] that supports the full ODBC API and performs the ODBC 3 to ODBC 2
[T] translations with UNICODE to ANSI conversion. It also includes a set of
[T] graphical utilities that allow users to specify connections to DBMSes to
[T] be used by applications, a collection of ODBC drivers including a simple
[T] text based driver, an NNTP driver, a Postgres driver and others, and a
[T] selection of templates and libraries that to aid in the construction of
[T] ODBC drivers. It works with MySQL, Postgres, StarOffice/OpenOffice,
[T] Applixware, iHTML, PHP, Perl DBD::ODBC, and many other applications and
[T] drivers. Connection pooling is also provided to increase performance with
[T] applications such as PHP.
