[I] An Embeddable SQL Database Engine

[T] SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database
[T] engine. Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database
[T] access without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes
[T] with a standalone command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used
[T] to administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how
[T] to use the SQLite library.
[T]
[T] SQLite is not a client library used to connect to a big database
[T] server. SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and writes directly
[T] to and from the database files on disk.
