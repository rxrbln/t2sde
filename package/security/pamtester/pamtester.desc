[I] A program for testing pluggable authentication modules (PAM) facility

[T] pamtester is a tiny program to test the pluggable authentication modules
[T] (PAM) facility, which is a de facto standard of unified authentication
[T] management mechanism in many unices and similar OSes including Solaris,
[T] HP-UX, *BSD, MacOSX and Linux.
[T]
[T] While specifically designed to help PAM module authors to test their
[T] modules, that might also be handy for system administrators interested
[T] in building a centralised authentication system using common standards
[T] such as NIS, SASL and LDAP.
