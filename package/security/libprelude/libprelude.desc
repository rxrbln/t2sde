[I] The xentral library for Prelude-IDS components

[T] LibPrelude, the glue that binds all aspects of Prelude-IDS together.
[T] LibPrelude is a library which enables Prelude components to communicate
[T] in a standard IDMEF [Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format] method.
[T] LibPrelude also makes it easy for third party software to be made
[T] Prelude Aware (able to communicate with Prelude components via IDMEF).
