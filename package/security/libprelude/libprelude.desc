[I] The central library for Prelude-IDS framework 

[T] Libprelude is the library that provide the framework used to access the 
[T] Prelude system. It handles secured communications with one or several 
[T] prelude-manager collector, and provide an API (Application Programming 
[T] Interface) to create IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format) 
[T] based events. 
[T] It also provides important features like failover (saving to a local 
[T] file for later retransmission, usage of a fallback route), in case one 
[T] of the prelude-manager server used goes down. 
[T] Moreover, it gives you the ability to create sensor that read events 
[T] received by one or a set of prelude-manager. 
[T] You could for example write an interactive notification system using 
[T] this feature.
