[I] An open re-implementation of the SSH package

[T] This is a Linux port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH. OpenSSH is
[T] based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with all
[T] patent-encumbered algorithms removed, all known security bugs
[T] fixed, new features reintroduced, and many other clean-ups.
[T]
[T] SSH (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a
[T] network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files
[T] from one machine to another.  It provides strong authentication and
[T] secure communications over insecure channels.  It is intended as a
[T] replacement for rlogin, rsh, rcp, and rdist.
