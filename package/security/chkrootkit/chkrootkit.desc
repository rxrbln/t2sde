[T] a chkrootkit: shell script that checks system binaries for rootkit
[T] modification. The following tests are made: aliens, asp, bindshell, lkm,
[T] rexedcs, sniffer, wted, z2, amd, basename, biff, chfn, chsh, cron, date,
[T] du, dirname, echo, egrep, env, find, fingerd, gpm, grep, hdparm, su, 
[T] ifconfig, inetd, inetdconf, identd, killall, login, ls, mail, mingetty,
[T] netstat, named, passwd, pidof, pop2, pop3, ps, pstree, rpcinfo, rlogind,
[T] rshd, slogin, sendmail, sshd, syslogd, tar, tcpd, top, telnetd, timed,
[T] traceroute, and write. ifpromisc.c checks whether the interface is in
[T] promiscuous mode, chklastlog.c checks for lastlog deletions, chkwtmp.c

[T] (Solaris only), and chkproc.c checks for signs of LKM trojans.
