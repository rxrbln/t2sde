[I] A utility to encrypt files

[T] Bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility. Encrypted files are
[T] portable across all supported operating systems and processors. Passphrases
[T] are between 8 and 56 characters and are hashed internally to a 448 bit
[T] key. However, all characters supplied are significant. The stronger your
[T] passphrase, the more secure your data.
