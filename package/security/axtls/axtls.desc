[I] A TLSv1 SSL library designed specifically for embedded devices

[T] AxTLS is a highly configurable client/server TLSv1 SSL library
[T] designed for embedded platforms. It comes with a small HTTPS server and
[T] additional test tools. It features a very small footprint, use of TLSv1
[T] (an improvement on SSLv3), session resumption, AES128/AES256 (as well
[T] as RC4), portability across many systems, variable RSA key sizes, a very
[T] simple API, peer client/server verification, certificate chaining, session
[T] renegotiation, highly configurable compile-time options, and interfaces
[T] for C#, VB. NET, Java, and Perl. It also implements a Web server.
