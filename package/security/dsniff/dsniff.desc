[I] Sniffing utilities for network security testing and auditing

[T] Dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration
[T] testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy
[T] passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files,
[T] etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network
[T] traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2
[T] switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle
[T] attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak
[T] bindings in ad-hoc PKI.
[T] This version of the package was patched by Denis Ducamp to compile
[T] with newer versions of the affected libraries. Not all binaries are
[T] built though!
