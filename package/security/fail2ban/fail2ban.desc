[I] Daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors

[T] Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/auth.log and bans IP addresses
[T] conducting too many failed login attempts. It does this by updating system
[T] firewall rules to reject new connections from those IP addresses, for a
[T] configurable amount of time. Fail2Ban comes out-of-the-box ready to read
[T] many standard log files, such as those for sshd and Apache, and is easily
[T] configured to read any log file of your choosing, for any error you wish.
