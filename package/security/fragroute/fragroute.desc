[I] A network IDS evasion tool

[T] fragroute intercepts, modifies, and rewrites egress traffic,
[T] implementing most of the attacks described in the Secure
[T] Networks "Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding
[T] Network Intrusion Detection" paper.
[T] It features a simple ruleset language to delay, duplicate,
[T] drop, fragment, overlap, print, reorder, segment, source-route,
[T] or otherwise monkey with all outbound packets destined for a
[T] target host, with minimal support for randomized or probabi-
[T] listic behaviour. This tool was written in good faith to aid
[T] in the testing of intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and
[T] basic TCP/IP stack behaviour.
