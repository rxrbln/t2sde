[I] A general SmartCard library and applications with PKCS #15 support

[T] OpenSC consists of a SmartCard library that uses any common
[T] transport API (e.g. PC/SC, CT-API, OpenCT) as its backend and
[T] applications that use the library. It has been tested extensively
[T] on Finnish Electronic Identity (FINEID) cards, but a number of other
[T] PKCS #15 and ISO 7816 compatible cards work too. Also implemented are
[T] a PKCS #11 module (e.g. for Mozilla Web/email usage), a PAM module,
[T] somewhat working OpenSSH support, an OpenSSL engine, a few basic
[T] tools, and a PKCS #15 structure generation tool for supported cards.
