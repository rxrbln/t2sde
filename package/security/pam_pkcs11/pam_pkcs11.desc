[I] A PAM library for authentication with PKCS#11 compliant tokens

[T] PAM_pkcs#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509
[T] certificate based user login. The certificate and its dedicated
[T] private key are thereby accessed by means of an appropriate PKCS#11
[T] module. For the verification of the users certificates,
[T] locally stored CA certificates as well as either online or
[T] locally accessible CRLs are used. A very flexible, stackable,
[T] and configurable Certificate-To-Login mapping scheme is
[T] provided to deduce/verify the username to log in.
