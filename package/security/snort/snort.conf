# FlexResp feature
# NOTE: At time of writing, FlexResp:
# (a) is considered in Alpha stage and "to be used with caution"
# (b) requires libnet
# (c) does not work with libnet 1.1 (the latest stable release)
# (d) works only with libnet 1.02a, which is deprecated
# For these reasons, FlexResp is not enabled.
# var_append extraconfopt " " "--enable-flexresp"

# snort-inline isn't building due to libnet 1.02a dependency
# see Note above
