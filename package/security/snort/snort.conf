# FlexResp feature
# NOTE: At time of writing, FlexResp:
# (a) is considered in Alpha stage and "to be used with caution" 
# (b) requires libnet, which is an unmaintained package in ROCK
# (c) does not work with libnet 1.1 (the latest stable release)
# (d) works only with libnet 1.02a, which is deprecated
# For these reasons, FlexResp is not enabled.
