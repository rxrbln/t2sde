[I] Open Source toolkit for Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security

[T] The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
[T] commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the
[T] Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1)
[T] protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.
[T] The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the
[T] Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its
[T] related documentation.
