[I] Free replacement for Tripwire(tm)

[T] AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a free replacement for
[T] Tripwire(tm). It generates a database that can be used to check the
[T] integrity of files on server. It uses regular expressions for determining
[T] which files get added to the database. You can use several message digest
[T] algorithms to ensure that the files have not been tampered with.
