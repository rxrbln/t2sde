[I] Client-side implementation of the HBCI specification

[T] HBCI is a bank-independent homebanking standard used by many German
[T] banks. This publicly available protocol describes communication,
[T] authentification, encryption, and business transactions taking place
[T] between a homebanking applications and any arbitrary HBCI-enabled bank
[T] server. OpenHBCI provides an object oriented library implementing the
[T] current client-side HBCI specification. The library is written in C++,
[T] with C wrappers also available.
