[I] A LUKS aware cryptsetup replacement for dm-crypt

[T] LUKS for dm-crypt is implemented in cryptsetup. cryptsetup-luks is intended
[T] as a complete replacement for the original cryptsetup. It provides all the
[T] functionally of the original version plus all LUKS features, that are
[T] accessable by luks* action.
[T] LUKS is the upcoming standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing
[T] a standard on-disk-format, it does not only facilitate compatibility among
[T] distributions, but also provide secure management of multiple user
[T] passwords. In contrast to existing solution, LUKS stores all setup necessary
[T] setup information in the partition header, enabling the user to transport
[T] or migrate his data seamlessly.
