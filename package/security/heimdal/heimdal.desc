[I] A Kerberos 5 implementation.

[T] Heimdal is an implementation of Kerberos 5 
[T] that aims to be protocol compatible with 
[T] existing implementations and RFC 1510. It is 
[T] also reasonably compatible with the M.I.T 
[T] Kerberos V5 API, supports Kerberos V5 over 
[T] GSS-API (RFC 1964), includes a number of 
[T] important and useful applications (rsh, telnet, 
[T] popper, etc.), and is backwards compatible 
[T] with Kerberos V4. Kerberos V4 support should not 
[T] be used if possible as it has security weaknesses.
