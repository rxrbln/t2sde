[I] A working SSH implementation by means of a library

[T] The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working
[T] SSH implementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the
[T] client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute
[T] programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your
[T] remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with
[T] remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto
[T] (from openssl).
