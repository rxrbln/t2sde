[I] GnuPG Made Easy (Python bindings)

[T] The gpgmepy module is a python interface to the GPGME library. Gpgmepy
[T] offers two interfaces, one is a high-level, curated, and idiomatic
[T] interface that is implemented as a shim on top of the low-level interface
[T] automatically created using SWIG. This way we make simple things easy,
[T] while still providing the entire functionality of the underlying library.
