[I] A next-generation scanning tool for pentesters

[T] Amap (Application MAPper) attempts to identify applications even if they are
[T] running on a different port than normal.
[T] It also identifies non-ascii based applications. This is achieved by sending
[T] trigger packets, and looking up the responses in a list of response strings.
