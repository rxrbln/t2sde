[I] Prelude Sensor for Host Intrusion Detection

[T] Prelude-LML (Prelude Log Monitoring Lackey) is a sensor for the Prelude-
[T] IDS. Prelude-LML deals with the host based intrusion detection aspects.
[T] 
[T] As one function, it can 'listen' on the network for 'Syslog messages'
[T] coming from different hosts on heterogeneous platforms.
[T] Any system that generates logs from standard Unix Syslog and transmits them
[T] to the LML host should be capable of utilizing Prelude-LML's analysis
[T] Enbgine.
[T]
[T] Prelude-LML's primary function is log analysis. Logs on a local system, or
[T] logs monitored over the network from other hosts can be processed and
[T] analysed order to discover security anomolies.
