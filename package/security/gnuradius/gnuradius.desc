[I] An extensible SQL/SNMP-enabled Radius server with Scheme scripting interface

[T] GNU Radius is a radius server and an accompanying set of monitoring
[T] utilities. It features MySQL and PostgreSQL interfaces for authentication
[T] and/or logging (the ODBC interface allows you to use almost any existing
[T] DBMS for that purpose), the ability to rewrite RADIUS requests from
[T] various NASs to normalize them to a more understandable format, as well as
[T] the ability to completely customize the behavior of radius authentication
[T] and accounting based on NAS and user attributes.
