[I] Innovative security model for 2.4 and 2.6 Linux Kernels 

[T] grsecurity is an innovative approach to security utilizing 
[T] a multi-layered detection, prevention, and containment model. 
[T] It offers among many other features:
[T] 
[T] - An intelligent and robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
[T]   system that can generate least privilege policies for your 
[T]   entire system with no configuration
[T] - Change root (chroot) hardening
[T] - /tmp race prevention
[T] - Extensive auditing
[T] - Prevention of entire classes of exploits related to address 
[T]   space bugs (from the PaX project)
[T] - Additional randomness in the TCP/IP stack
[T] - A restriction that allows a user to only view his/her processes
[T] - Every security alert or audit contains the IP address of the 
[T]   person that caused the event
