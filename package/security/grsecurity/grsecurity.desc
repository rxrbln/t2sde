[I] Innovative security model for 2.4 and 2.6 Linux Kernels

[T] grsecurity is an innovative approach to security utilizing
[T] a multi-layered detection, prevention, and containment model.
[T] It offers among many other features:
[T]
[T] - An intelligent and robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
[T]   system that can generate least privilege policies for your
[T]   entire system with no configuration
[T] - Change root (chroot) hardening
[T] - /tmp race prevention
[T] - Extensive auditing
[T] - Prevention of entire classes of exploits related to address
[T]   space bugs (from the PaX project)
[T] - Additional randomness in the TCP/IP stack
[T] - A restriction that allows a user to only view his/her processes
[T] - Every security alert or audit contains the IP address of the
[T]   person that caused the event
