[I] API to create and parse X.509 and CMS related objects

[T] Libksba is a library to make the tasks of working with X.509
[T] certificates, CMS data and related objects more easy. It provides a
[T] highlevel interface to the implemented protocols and presents the data
[T] in a consistent way. There is no more need to worry about all the
[T] nasty details of the protocols.
