[I] Library that provides easy access to the Prelude database

[T] The PreludeDB Library provides an abstraction layer upon the type and the
[T] format of the database used to store IDMEF alerts.
[T] It allows developers to use the Prelude IDMEF database easily and efficiently
[T] without worrying about SQL, and to access the database independently of the
[T] type/format of the database.
