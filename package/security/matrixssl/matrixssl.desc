[I] An embedded SSL implementation for small footprint devices

[T] PeerSec MatrixSSL is an embedded SSL implementation designed for
[T] small footprint devices and applications requiring low overhead per
[T] connection. The library is less than 50K on disk with cipher suites. It
[T] includes SSL client and SSL server support, session resumption, and
[T] implementations of RSA, 3DES, ARC4, SHA1, and MD5. The source is well
[T] documented and contains portability layers for additional operating
[T] systems, cipher suites, and cryptography providers.
