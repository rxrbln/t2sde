[I] A file integrity checker and host-based intrusion detection

[T] samhain is a multiplatform, open source solution for centralized file
[T] integrity checking / host-based intrusion detection on POSIX systems
[T] (Unix, Linux, Cygwin/Windows). It has been designed to monitor multiple
[T] hosts with potentially different operating systems from a central location,
[T] although it can also be used as standalone application on a single host.
