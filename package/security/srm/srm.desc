[I] Secure file deletion for POSIX systems

[T] srm is a secure replacement for rm(1).
[T] Unlike the standard rm, it overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them.
[T] This prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw block device.
[T] It may also help frustrate physical examination of the disk,
[T] although it's unlikely that it can completely prevent that type of recovery.
[T] It is, essentially, a paper shredder for sensitive files.
