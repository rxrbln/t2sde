[I] Advanced network audit tool/portscanner

[T] nmap is a network analysis and exploration tool that looks for
[T] open communications ports on a TCP/IP stack. What makes it
[T] different from most other systems is the ability to do so stealthy
[T] and very precise. Since the days of the original phrack article
[T] and the 1.49 release, it developed to a complete system identification
[T] tool. It is capable of identifying most operating systems based on
[T] handling of unlikely packet flag combinations.
[T] This version adds direct (non-portmapper) RPC scanning to the
[T] already impressive list of features. This feature allows to gain
[T] quite useful information on rpc-services even when the target
[T] has firewalled the rpc-portmapper-port.
