[I] Rule Set Based Access Control for Linux

[T] RSBAC is a flexible, powerful and fast open source access control
[T] framework for current Linux kernels, which has been in stable production
[T] use since January 2000 (version 1.0.9a). All development is independent
[T] of governments and big companies, and no existing access control code has
[T] been reused.
[T]
[T] The standard package includes a range of access control models like MAC,
[T] RC, ACL (see below). Furthermore, the runtime registration facility (REG)
[T] makes it easy to implement your own access control model as a kernel
[T] module and get it registered at runtime.
