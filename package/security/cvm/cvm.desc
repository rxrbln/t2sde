[I] Credential Validation Modules

[T] CVM is a framework for validating a set of credentials against a database
[T] using a filter program. The modules act as a filter, taking a set of
[T] credentials as input and writing a set of facts as output if those
[T] credentials are valid. Optional input is given to the module through
[T] environment variables.
[T]
[T] Some of the ideas for CVM came from experience with PAM (pluggable
[T] authentication modules), the checkpassword interface used by qmail-pop3d,
[T] and the "authmod" interface used by Courier IMAP and POP3. This framework
[T] places fewer restrictions on the invoking client than checkpassword does,
[T] and is much simpler to implement on both sides than PAM and the authmod
[T] framework.
[T] 
[T] This package contains:
[T] - The reference source for the CVM interface.
[T] - Diagnostic and benchmark CVM clients.
[T] - A checkpassword interface CVM client.
[T] - A UNIX/POSIX system module (uses getpwnam).
[T] - A flat-file module.
[T] - A library for client writers.
[T] - A set of libraries for module writers.
