[I] A simple syslog monitoring utility/daemon watchdog

[T] Swatch was originally written to actively monitor messages as they were
[T] written to a log file via the UNIX syslog utility. It has multiple methods
[T] of alarming, both visually and by triggering events. The perfect tools
[T] for a master loghost. It is known to work flawlessly on Linux (RH5),
[T] BSDI, and Solaris 2. 6 (patched).
