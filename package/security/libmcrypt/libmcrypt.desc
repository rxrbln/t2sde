[I] A library for encryption. It can be built into PHP

[T] mcrypt is intended to be a replacement of the old unix
[T] crypt(1) under the GNU General Public License. Unix Crypt(1)
[T] was a popular(?)  file encryption program in unix boxes. It
[T] was based on the enigma encryption algorithm but it was
[T] considerable trivialized. Since this was not adequate, even
[T] for individual privacy needs, I decided to create a similar
[T] program using some modern block encryption algorithms. Mcrypt
[T] also has a compatibility mode with unix crypt(1) and with
[T] solaris des(1). It supports all the algorithms and modes
[T] found in libmcrypt and it is very extendable. At the time
[T] writing this, it supports the algorithms: BLOWFISH, TWOFISH,
[T] DES, TripleDES, 3-WAY, SAFER, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, MARS,
[T] RIJNDAEL, SERPENT, CAST, ARCFOUR and WAKE.  Block algorithms
[T] are implemented in modes: CFB, CBC, CTR, ECB, OFB (8 bit and
[T] n bit, where n is the size of the algorithm's block length).
