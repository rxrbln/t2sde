[I] A Qt Cryptographic Architecture (QCA) ver2

[T] QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API,
[T] using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API from the
[T] implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of this
[T] model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly
[T] depending on any particular cryptographic library. This allows one to
[T] easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without even needing to
[T] recompile the application! QCA should work everywhere Qt does, including
[T] Windows/Unix/MacOSX.
