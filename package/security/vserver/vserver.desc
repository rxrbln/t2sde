[I] Virtual private servers and security contexts

[T] VServer virtual servers operate like a normal Linux server, but allow 
[T] many independent servers to be run simultaneously in one box. These can 
[T] involve normal services such as telnet, mail, Web, and SQL servers - in
[T] most cases using a standard configuration. The services are unaware of 
[T] the virtual server concept. Each virtual server has its own user account
[T] database and root password. Each vserver uses standard packages and runs
[T] at the same speed as a non-VServer installation.
