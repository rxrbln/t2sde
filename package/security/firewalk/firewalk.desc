[I] A traceroute like tool to determine gateway ACL filters and to map networks

[T] Firewalking is a technique developed by MDS and DHG that employs
[T] traceroute-like techniques to analyze IP packet responses to
[T] determine gateway ACL filters and map networks. Firewalk the tool
[T] employs the technique to determine the filter rules in place
[T] on a packet forwarding device. The newest version of the tool,
[T] firewalk/GTK introduces the option of using a graphical interface
[T] and a few bug fixes.
