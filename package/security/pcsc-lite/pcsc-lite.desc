[I] Winscard api as used under Windows(R) for Linux

[T] Welcome to PCSC Lite.  The purpose of PCSC Lite is to
[T] provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in a very small form factor for
[T] communicating to smartcards and readers. PCSC Lite can be compiled
[T] directly to a desired reader driver or can be used to dynamically
[T] allocate/deallocate reader drivers at runtime (default).
