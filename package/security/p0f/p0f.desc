[I] A passive OS fingerprinting tool

[T] p0f is a versatile passive OS fingerprinting and masquerade
[T] detection utility, to be used for evidence or information
[T] gathering on servers, firewalls, IDSes, and honeypots, for
[T] pen-testing, or just for the fun of it. It is a complete rewrite
[T] of p0f version 1 that used to be maintained by William Stearns.
