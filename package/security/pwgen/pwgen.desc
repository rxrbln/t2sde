[I] Pronounceable password generator

[T] pwgen  generates passwords which are designed to be easily memorized by
[T] humans, while being as secure as possible. Used interactively, pwgen will
[T] display a screenful of passwords, allowing the user to pick a single
[T] password, and then quickly erase the screen. When standard output is not a
[T] tty, pwgen will only generate one password.
