[I] A tool that offers secure deletion of files from magnetic media.

[T] Wipe repeatedly writes special patterns to the file or files to be
[T] destroyed, using the fsync() call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force
[T] disk access, in order to lessen the chance of data recovery using
[T] techniques such as magnetic force microscopy.
