[I] The GNU Privacy Guard

[T] GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
[T] It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
[T] It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
[T] with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440.
[T]
[T] Because GnuPG does not use use any patented algorithm it cannot be
[T] compatible with PGP2 versions.  PGP 2.x uses IDEA (which is patented
[T] worldwide).
[T]
[T] The default algorithms are DSA and ElGamal.  ElGamal for signing
[T] is still available, but because of the larger size of such
[T] signatures it is deprecated (Please note that the GnuPG
[T] implementation of ElGamal signatures is *not* insecure).  Symmetric
[T] algorithms are: 3DES, Blowfish, CAST5 and Twofish (GnuPG does not
[T] yet create Twofish encrypted messages because there is no agreement
[T] in the OpenPGP WG on how to use it together with a MDC algorithm)
[T] Digest algorithms available are MD5, RIPEMD160 and SHA1.
