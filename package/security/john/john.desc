[I] A password cracker to detect weak Unix (and other) passwords

[T] John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many
[T] flavors of Unix (11 are officially supported, not counting different 
[T] architectures), DOS, Win32, BeOS, and OpenVMS. Its primary purpose is to
[T] detect weak Unix passwords. It supports several crypt(3) password hash 
[T] types which are most commonly found on various Unix flavors, as well as 
[T] Kerberos AFS and Windows NT/2000/XP LM hashes. Several other hash types
[T] are added with contributed patches.
