[I] Restricted ssh

[T] rssh is a restricted shell for use with OpenSSH, allowing only scp and/or
[T] sftp. For example, if you have a server which you only want to allow users
[T] to copy files off of via scp, without providing shell access, you can use
[T] rssh to do that. For a list of platforms on which rssh is known to work,
[T] see the Platform Support Page.
