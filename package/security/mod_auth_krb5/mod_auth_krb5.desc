[I] Kerberos authentication for Apache

[T] Mod_auth_kerb is an Apache module designed to provide Kerberos
[T] authentication to the Apache web server. Using the Basic Auth
[T] mechanism, it retrieves a username/password pair from the browser and
[T] checks them against a Kerberos server as set up by your
[T] particular organization. The module also supports the Negotiate
[T] authentication method, which performs full Kerberos authentication based
[T] on ticket exchanges, and does not require users to insert their
[T] passwords to the browser.
