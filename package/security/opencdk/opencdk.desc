[I] Open Crypto Development Kit

[T] This library provides basic parts of the OpenPGP message format.
[T] For reference, please read the rfc2440.txt in the doc/ directory.
[T] The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available OpenPGP version.
[T] There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke,
[T] alter preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentary
[T] available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
[T] packets and to use basic operations. For example to encrypt/decrypt
[T] or to sign/verify and packet routines.
