[I] Jakarta Commons Collections

[T] The Java Collections Framework  was a major addition in JDK 1.2. It
[T] added many powerful data structures that accelerate development of
[T] most significant Java applications. Since that time it has become the
[T] recognised standard for collection handling in Java.
[T]
[T] Commons-Collections seek to build upon the JDK classes by providing
[T] new interfaces, implementations and utilities.
