[I] extensible universal IDE written in java

[T] Eclipse is a kind of universal tool platform - an open extensible IDE
[T] for anything and nothing in particular. The real value of Eclipse comes
[T] from tool plug-ins that "teach" Eclipse how to work with things - java
[T] files, web content, graphics, video, etc. Eclipse allows you to
[T] independently develop tools that integrate with other people's tools
[T] seamlessly.
[T]
[T] The Platform defines the set of frameworks and common services that
[T] collectively make up "integration-ware" required to support the use of
[T] Eclipse as a component model, as a rich client platform (RCP) and as a
[T] comprehensive tool integration platform. These services and frameworks
[T] include a standard workbench user interface model and portable native
[T] widget toolkit, a project model for managing resources, automatic
[T] resource delta management for incremental compilers and builders,
[T] language-independent debug infrastructure, and infrastructure for
[T] distributed multi-user versioned resource management.
