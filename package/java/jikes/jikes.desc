[I] A compiler for the Java language

[T] Jikes is a compiler for the JavaTM language. The Jikes project
[T] strives for strict adherence to the Java Language Specification
[T] and the Java Virtual Machine Specification. Jikes' most popular
[T] feature is the extremely fast compile speed gained by built-in
[T] dependence analysis and incremental compilation, as well as being
[T] written in C++ rather than Java.
