[I] Jakarta Commons HttpClient 

[T] Although the java.net  package provides basic functionality for 
[T] accessing resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility 
[T] or functionality needed by many applications. The Jakarta Commons 
[T] HttpClient component seeks to fill this void by providing an efficient, 
[T] up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side of 
[T] the most recent HTTP standards and recommendations.
