[I] 100% Java Regular Expressions Package

[T] Apache Jakarta Regexp is a 100% pure Java regular expression
[T] package. Expression syntax supports all of Perl5 syntax, with the
[T] exception of back reference substitution markers (several people
[T] have mentioned this lack, so please feel free to contribute
[T] a solution). It also supports a very limited subset of POSIX
[T] features. Performance and features are somewhat inferior to ORO,
[T] and the new JDK 1.4 (java.util.regex) package, but the package is
[T] especially small and features the ability to precompile expressions
[T] (without using object serialization) into byte arrays, thus avoiding
[T] the need to load the expression compiler.
