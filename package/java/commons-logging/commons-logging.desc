[I] Jakarta Commons Logging

[T] The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different
[T] logging libraries. Commons components may use the Logging API
[T] to remove compile-time and run-time dependencies on any particular
[T] logging package, and contributors may write Log implementations
[T] for the library of their choice.
