[I] Jakarta Commons Logging 

[T] The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different 
[T] logging libraries. Commons components may use the Logging API 
[T] to remove compile-time and run-time dependencies on any particular 
[T] logging package, and contributors may write Log implementations 
[T] for the library of their choice.
