[I] Jakarta ORO

[T] The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java
[T] classes that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions, AWK-like
[T] regular expressions, glob expressions, and utility classes for
[T] performing substitutions, splits, filtering filenames, etc. This
[T] library is the successor to the OROMatcher, AwkTools, PerlTools,
[T] and TextTools libraries originally from ORO, Inc. Despite little
[T] activity in the form of new development initiatives, issue reports,
[T] questions, and suggestions are responded to quickly.
