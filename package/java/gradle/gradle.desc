[I] A build tool with a focus on build automation and multi-language development

[T] A build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
[T] multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and
[T] deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that
[T] can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging
[T] code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build
[T] automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala,
[T] Android, Kotlin, C/C++, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with
[T] development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse,
[T] IntelliJ, and Jenkins.
