[I] Jakarta BSF - Bean Scripting Framework

[T] Bean Scripting Framework (bSF) is a set of Java classes which provides 
[T] scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java 
[T] Objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write 
[T] JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java 
[T] class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be 
[T] implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is 
[T] embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits 
[T] calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an 
[T] object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language 
[T] engines.
