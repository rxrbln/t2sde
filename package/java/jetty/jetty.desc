[I] A 100% Java based HTTP Server and Servlet Container

[T] Jetty is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container. This means
[T] that you do not need to configure and run a separate web server
[T] (like Apache) in order to use java, servlets and JSPs to generate
[T] dynamic content. Jetty is a fully featured web server for static
[T] and dynamic content. Unlike separate server/container solutions, this
[T] means that your web server and web application run in the same process,
[T] without interconnection overheads and complications. Furthermore,
[T] as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply included in your
[T] application for demonstration, distribution or deployment. Jetty
[T] is available on all Java supported platforms.
