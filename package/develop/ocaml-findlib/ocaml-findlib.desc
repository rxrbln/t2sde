[I] O'Caml library manager

[T] O'Caml Findlib is a library manager for Objective Caml. It provides a
[T] convention how to store libraries, and a file format ("META") to
[T] describe the properties of libraries. There is also a tool (ocamlfind)
[T] for interpreting the META files, so that it is very easy to use
[T] libraries in programs and scripts.
