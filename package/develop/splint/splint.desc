[I] C Syntax Checker - a successor to lint

[T] Splint is a tool for statically checking C programs for security
[T] vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint
[T] can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is invested
[T] adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform stronger
[T] checking than can be done by any standard lint.
