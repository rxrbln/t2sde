[I] A library that generates assembly code at run time

[T] GNU Lightning is a library that generates assembly language code at
[T] run time. It is very fast, making it ideal for Just-In-Time compilers,
[T] and it abstracts over the target CPU, as it exposes to the clients a
[T] standardized RISC instruction set (inspired by the MIPS and SPARC chips).
