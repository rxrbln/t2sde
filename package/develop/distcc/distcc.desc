[I] A fast, free distributed C/C++/... compiler frontend

[T] Distcc is a program to distribute builds of C, C++, Objective C or
[T] Objective C++ code across several machines on a network. distcc should
[T] always generate the same results as a local build, is simple to install
[T] and use, and is often two or more times faster than a local compile.
[T]
[T] Distcc does not require all machines to share a filesystem, have
[T] synchronized clocks, or to have the same libraries or header files
[T] installed. They can even have different processors or operating systems,
[T] if cross-compilers are installed.
