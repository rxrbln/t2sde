[I] A library for asynchronous event notification

[T] The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback
[T] function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor
[T] or after a timeout has been reached. It is meant to replace
[T] the asynchronous event loop found in event-driven network servers.
