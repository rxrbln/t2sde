[I] GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

[T] The 'make' utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program
[T] need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them. This is GNU
[T] 'make', which was implemented by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath. GNU
[T] 'make' conforms to section 6.2 of EEE Standard 1003.2-1992' (POSIX.2).
