[I] A BASIC compiler, with high-level GUI

[T] BaCon is a free BASIC to C translator for Unix-based systems, which runs
[T] on most Unix/Linux/BSD platforms, including MacOSX. It intends to be a
[T] programming aid in creating tools which can be compiled on different
[T] platforms (including 64bit environments), while trying to revive the days
[T] of the good old BASIC.
