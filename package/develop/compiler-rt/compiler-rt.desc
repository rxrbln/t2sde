[I] Compiler runtime libraries

[T] A simple library that provides an implementation of the low-level
[T] target-specific hooks required by code generation and other runtime
[T] components. For example, when compiling for a 32-bit target, converting
[T] a double to a 64-bit unsigned integer is compiling into a runtime call
[T] to the "__fixunsdfdi" function.
