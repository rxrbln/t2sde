[I] A library for handling page faults

[T] GNU libsigsegv is a library for handling page faults. A page fault occurs
[T] when a program tries to access a region of memory that is currently not
[T] available. Catching and handling a page fault is a useful technique for
[T] implementing garbage collectors, stack overflow handlers, persistent
[T] databases, and distributed shared memory.
