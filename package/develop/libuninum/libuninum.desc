[I] A library for converting strings to numbers

[T] Libuninum is a library for converting Unicode strings to numbers. Internal
[T] computation is done using arbitrary precision arithmetic, so there is
[T] no limit on the size of the integer that can be converted. The value is
[T] returned as an ASCII decimal string, a GNU MP object, or an unsigned
[T] long integer. Auto-detection of the number system is provided. The
[T] number systems supported include Arabic, Armenian, Balinese, Bengali,
[T] Burmese, Chinese, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Egyptian, Ethiopic, Glagolitic,
[T] Greek, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Hebrew, Kannada, Khmer, Klingon, Lao, Limbu,
[T] Malayalam, Mongolian, New Tai Lue, Nko, Old Italic, Old Persian, Oriya,
[T] Osmanya, Perso-Arabic, Phoenician, Roman Numerals, Tamil, Telugu, Tengwar,
[T] Thai, and Tibetan.
