[I] Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language

[T] Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for
[T] extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose,
[T] stand-alone language.
[T]
[T] Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
[T] constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is
[T] dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic memory
[T] management with garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration,
[T] scripting, and rapid prototyping.
