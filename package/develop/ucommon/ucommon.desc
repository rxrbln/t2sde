[I] C++ threading for embedded applications

[T] UCommon is a lightweight C++ library to facilitate using C++ design
[T] patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for
[T] systems using uClibc along with POSIX threading support. For this
[T] reason, UCommon disables language features that consume memory or
[T] introduce runtime overhead. UCommon introduces some design patterns from
[T] Objective-C, such as reference counted objects, memory pools, and smart
[T] pointers. UCommon introduces some new concepts for handling of thread
[T] locking and synchronization.
