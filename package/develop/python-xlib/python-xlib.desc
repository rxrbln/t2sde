[I] The Python X Library

[T] The Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X client
[T] library for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in contrast
[T] to earlier X libraries for Python (the ancient X extension and the newer
[T] plxlib) which were interfaces to the C Xlib.
