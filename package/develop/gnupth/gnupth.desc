[I] GNU Portable Threads

[T] GNU Portable Threads (Pth) is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C
[T] based library for Unix platforms providing non-preemptive
[T] priority-based scheduling for multiple threads of execution
[T] (multithreading) inside server applications. All
[T] threads run in the same address space, but each thread has its own
[T] individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno
[T] variable. The scheduling is done in a cooperative way, i.e. the
[T] threads are dispatched based on priority and pending events. The
[T] event facility allows threads to wait until various types of events
[T] occur, including pending I/O on filedescriptors, elapsed timers,
[T] pending I/O on message ports, thread and process termination,
[T] and even customized callback functions.
