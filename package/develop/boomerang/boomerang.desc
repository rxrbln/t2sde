[I] A decompiler for native executables

[T] Boomerang is a decompiler that takes executable files and
[T] attempts to create a high level, compilable, possibly even
[T] maintainable source file that does the same thing. It does
[T] not matter if the executable file has symbols or not,
[T] or whether it was compiled using any particular language.
