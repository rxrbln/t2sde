[I] Static analysis of C/C++ code

[T] Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code. It provides unique code
[T] analysis to detect bugs and focuses on detecting undefined behaviour and
[T] dangerous coding constructs. The goal is to have very few false positives.
[T] Cppcheck is designed to be able to analyze your C/C++ code even if it has
[T] non-standard syntax (common in embedded projects).
