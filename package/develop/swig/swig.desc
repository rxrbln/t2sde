[I] Toolkit for connecting C and C++ programs with script languages

[T] SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written 
[T] in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. 
[T] SWIG is primarily used with common scripting languages such as Perl, 
[T] Python, Tcl/Tk, Ruby, Guile and MzScheme, however the list of 
[T] supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as 
[T] Java, OCAML, CHICKEN, and C#. SWIG is most commonly used to create 
[T] high-level interpreted programming environments, user interfaces, 
[T] and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/ C++ software.
