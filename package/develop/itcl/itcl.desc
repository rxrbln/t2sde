[I] Incremental TCL (TCL extension)

[T] incrTCL provides the extra language support needed to build large
[T] Tcl/Tk applications. It introduces the notion of objects, which act as
[T] building blocks for an application. Each object is a bag of data with
[T] a set of procedures or "methods" that are used to manipulate
[T] it. Objects are organized into "classes" with identical
[T] characteristics, and classes can inherit functionality from one
[T] another. This object-oriented paradigm adds another level of
[T] organization on top of the basic variable/procedure elements, and the
[T] resulting code is easier to understand and maintain.
