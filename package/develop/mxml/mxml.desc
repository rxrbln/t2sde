[I] An extremely small XML parsing library for C

[T] Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can use to read
[T] XML and XML-like data files in your application without requiring
[T] large non-standard libraries. It only requires an ANSI C compatible
[T] compiler (GCC works, as do most vendors' ANSI C compilers) and
[T] a &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; program. It supports reading of UTF-8
[T] and UTF-16 and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML strings and files, and
[T] provides a hierarchical view of the file via a linked-list tree
[T] structure of typed nodes and functions for managing, traversing,
[T] indexing, and searching the tree.
