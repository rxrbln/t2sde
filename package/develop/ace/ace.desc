[I] An object-oriented C++ class library and framework

[T] The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is an object-oriented (OO)
[T] C++ framework that helps you develop and deploy high-performance networked
[T] applications faster and with less code to write and maintain. ACE is
[T] especially useful for systems that use network and/or inter-process
[T] communications and that take advantage of multithreading. While the
[T] ACE source code is free, that's not the only way you save money with
[T] ACE. ACE's wrappers and higher-level patterns help you develop your
[T] software quickly and portably, helping you to complete your projects on
[T] time and within budget.
