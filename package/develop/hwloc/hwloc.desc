[I] Portable Hardware Locality

[T] The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a
[T] portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the
[T] hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory
[T] nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading.
[T] It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory
[T] information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network
[T] interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It primarily aims at helping
[T] applications with gathering information about modern computing hardware
[T] so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.
