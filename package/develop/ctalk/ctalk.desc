[I] Object Oriented Extensions for C

[T] Ctalk provides object oriented programming features, like classes,
[T] methods, operator overloading, and inheritance to otherwise standard
[T] C programs. You can use only a few objects and classes in a program,
[T] or you can write programs entirely in Ctalk. The package provides a
[T] translator from Ctalk source code into C for compilation and a library
[T] that provides run-time support for class objects. The preprocessor, ctpp,
[T] is also available separately, and the package includes sample programs
[T] and documentation.
