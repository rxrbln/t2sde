[I] Solving Constraint Integer Programs

[T] Fast solver for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear
[T] programming (MINLP). It is also a framework for constraint integer
[T] programming and branch-cut-and-price. It allows for total control of the
[T] solution process and the access of detailed information down to the guts of
[T] the solver.
