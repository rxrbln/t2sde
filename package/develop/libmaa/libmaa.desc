[I] A library providing many low-level data structures

[T] The LIBMAA library provides many low-level data structures which are
[T] helpful for writing compilers, including hash tables, sets, lists,
[T] debugging support, and memory management. Although LIBMAA was
[T] designed and implemented as a foundation for the Khepera
[T] Transformation System, the data structures are generally applicable
[T] to a wide range of programming problems.
[T]
[T] The memory management routines are especially helpful for improving
[T] the performance of memory-intensive applications.
