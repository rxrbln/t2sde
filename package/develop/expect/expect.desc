[I] Lets you automate telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc

[T] Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as
[T] telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this
[T] stuff trivial. Expect is also useful for testing these same
[T] applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive
[T] applications in X11 GUIs. Expect can make easy all sorts of tasks that
[T] are prohibitively difficult with anything else. You will find that
[T] Expect is an absolutely invaluable tool - using it, you will be able
[T] to automate tasks that you've never even thought of before - and
[T] you'll be able to do this automation quickly and easily.
