[I] Source Lines of Code (SLOC) Counter

[T] SLOCCount (pronounced "sloc-count") is a suite of programs for counting
[T] physical source lines of code (SLOC) in potentially large software systems.
[T] Thus, SLOCCount is a "software metrics tool" or "software measurement
[T] tool". SLOCCount was developed by David A. Wheeler, originally to count
[T] SLOC in a GNU/Linux distribution, but it can be used for counting the SLOC
[T] of arbitrary software systems.
