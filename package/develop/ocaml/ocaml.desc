[I] Objective Caml is the latest implementation of the Caml dialect of ML

[T] Objective Caml is an implementation of the Caml dialect of ML extended 
[T] with class-based objects and a powerful module system in the style of 
[T] SML's. It continues the Caml Light effort in many ways (separate 
[T] compilation, low memory requirements, fast turnaround through bytecode 
[T] interpretation), but also significantly departs from Caml Light on other 
[T] points (objects, the module calculus, and a high-performance native-code 
[T] compiler).
