[I] Portable set of basis classes for C++

[T] Common C++ offers a set of "portable" classes that can be used to build
[T] highly portable applications in C++. In particular, Common C++ offers
[T] classes that abstract threading, sockets, synchronization, serial I/O,
[T] "config" file parsing, class object persistence, shared object module
[T] loading, daemon management, and optimized "block" and memory mapped file
[T] I/O under a set of consistent classes that your application can then
[T] be built from. The goal is to write your application to use the portable
[T] abstract services and classes of the Common C++ libraries rather than
[T] having to access low level system services directly.
