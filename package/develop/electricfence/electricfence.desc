[I] A debugger which detects memory allocation violations

[T] Electric Fence is a different kind of malloc() debugger. It uses the virtual
[T] memory hardware of your system to detect when software overruns the
[T] boundaries
[T] of a malloc() buffer. It will also detect any accesses of memory that has
[T] been released by free(). Because it uses the VM hardware for detection,
[T] Electric Fence stops your program on the first instruction that causes
[T] a bounds violation. It's then trivial to use a debugger to display the
[T] offending statement.
