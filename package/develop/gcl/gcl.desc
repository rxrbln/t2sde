[I] GNU Common Lisp

[T] GCL is one of the oldest Lisp systems still in use, and  as  such
[T] has  served as the basis for large lisp applications when comput-
[T] ers were much more limited than they are today,  particularly  in
[T] terms  of  available  memory.   Considerable effort was therefore
[T] made in the past to keep the memory image as small  as  possible.
