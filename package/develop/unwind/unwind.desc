[I] A portable and efficient library to determine the call-chain

[T] The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient
[T] C programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
[T] The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
[T] (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any
[T] point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The API supports both local
[T] (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation.
