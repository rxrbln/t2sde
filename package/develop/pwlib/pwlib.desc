[I] A portable application development class library.

[T] PWLib is a moderately large class library that was
[T] originally designed as a method to produce
[T] applications that run on both Microsoft Windows
[T] and Unix/X11 systems. It includes classes for I/O
[T] portability, multi-threading portability, aid in
[T] producing Unix daemons and NT services portably,
[T] and all sorts of Internet protocols. It also
[T] offers basic &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; classes such as arrays,
[T] linear lists, sorted lists (RB Tree), and
[T] dictionaries (hash tables) which were all created
[T] before the STL. This library is used by the
[T] OpenH323 library.
