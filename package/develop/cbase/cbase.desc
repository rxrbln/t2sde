[I] A C library for UNIX systems software development

[T] Cbase is a C library that simplifies systems software development
[T] on UNIX. The library includes functions for memory management, string
[T] parsing, sub-process execution, filesystem traversal, I/O, interfaces to
[T] IPC mechanisms including pseudo-terminals, shared memory, semaphores,
[T] and other facilities. It also has implementations of common dynamic
[T] data structures like linked lists, queues, stacks, and hash tables,
[T] a real-time scheduler similar in functionality to the cron daemon, and
[T] high-level APIs to Berkeley sockets and other networking functions. Full
[T] API documentation is included.
