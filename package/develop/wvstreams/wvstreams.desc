[I] A C++ network communications layer for rapid application development

[T] WvStreams is a library set composed of a number of parts. Among
[T] them are WvIPStreams (WvTCPStream and WvUDPStream), WvStrings (yet
[T] another C++ String class), WvCrypto Streams (including an easy way
[T] to add SSL support to applications), WvConf (a configuration file
[T] handler), WvLog (nice, simple handling of log files), and a whole
[T] host of other goodness. These are the base classes used to build
[T] programs such as the ever popular WvDial, TunnelVision, FastForward,
[T] KWvDial, and retchmail.
