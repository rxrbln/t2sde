[I] A library for efficient, lightweight text classification

[T] Libtextcat is a library with functions that implement the
[T] classification technique described in Cavnar Trenkle,
[T] N-Gram-Based Text Categorization.
[T] It was primarily developed for language guessing, a task on
[T] which it is known to perform with near- perfect accuracy.
[T] Considerable effort went into making this implementation
[T] fast and efficient. The language guesser processes over 100
[T] documents/second on a simple PC, which makes it practical
[T] for many uses.
