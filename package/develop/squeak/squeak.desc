[I] A portable Smalltalk 80-based language

[T] Squeak is an OpenSource and super-portable implementation of a multi-media
[T] capable Smalltalk-80 based object-oriented programming environment. It is
[T] written entirely in Smalltalk and has a high-performance VM, created by
[T] compiling the Smalltalk VM code into efficient and portable C code. It
[T] now uses the Self language's Morphic User Interface but still provides
[T] the original MVC GUI as well.
