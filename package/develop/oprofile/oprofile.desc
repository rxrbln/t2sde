[I] System-wide profiler for Linux systems

[T] OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of profiling
[T] all running code at low overhead. OProfile is released under the GNU GPL.
[T]
[T] It consists of a kernel driver and a daemon for collecting sample data,
[T] and several post-profiling tools for turning data into information.
[T]
[T] OProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU to
[T] enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics, which
[T] can also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code is profiled:
[T] hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel modules, the kernel,
[T] shared libraries, and applications.
