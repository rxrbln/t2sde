[I] Turns other processes into daemons

[T] Daemon turns other processes into daemons. There are many tedious tasks
[T] that need to be performed to correctly set up a daemon process; daemon
[T] performs these tasks for other processes. This is useful for writing
[T] daemons in languages other than C, C++, or Perl (e.g. sh, Java).
