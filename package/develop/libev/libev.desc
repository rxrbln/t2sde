[I] A high performance and full-featured C event loop

[T] Libev is a high-performance event loop for C (with optional and separate
[T] interfaces for C++ and Perl), featuring support for I/O, timers (relative
[T] and absolute, cron-like ones), signals, process status changes, and other
[T] types of events. It has both a fast native API and libevent emulation to
[T] support programs written using the libevent API. The libev distribution
[T] consists of libevent with the core event handling parts replaced by the
[T] libev embedded event loop. Differences to libevent include higher speed,
[T] simpler design, more features, less memory usage, embedability, and no
[T] arbitrary limits. Libev supports epoll, kqueue, Solaris event ports,
[T] poll, and select.
