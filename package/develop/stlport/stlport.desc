[I] A superior implementation of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

[T] The ANSI/ISO C++ specifcation includes a standard
[T] C++ library, also known as the STL. GCC by default
[T] comes with an implementation that does not comply
[T] with this standard, but instead partly implements
[T] an older version.  STLport is freely available
[T] version, based on the SGI STL implementation. It
[T] is fully-compliant, supported, and very fast.
[T] Includes special debugging facilities, and
[T] interesting and useful extensions to the standard.
