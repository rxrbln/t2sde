[I] An IDE with source code comprehension features

[T] Source-Navigator is a source code analysis tool. With it, you can edit
[T] your source code, display relationships between classes and functions
[T] and members, and display call trees. You can also build your projects,
[T] either with your own makefile, or by using Source-Navigator's build
[T] system to automatically generate a makefile. It works with the Insight GUI
[T] interface for GDB, and supports C, C++, Java, Tcl, [incr Tcl], FORTRAN,
[T] and COBOL, and provides an SDK so that you can write your own parsers.
