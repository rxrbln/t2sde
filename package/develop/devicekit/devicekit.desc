[I] An abstraction for enumerating devices and listening to device events

[T] DeviceKit is an abstraction for enumerating devices and listening to
[T] device events. Any application on the system can access the
[T] org.freedesktop.DeviceKit service via the system message bus. On
[T] GNU/Linux, DeviceKit can be considered a simple D-Bus frontend to
[T] udev(7).
