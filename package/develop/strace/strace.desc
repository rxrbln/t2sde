[I] Trace system calls and signals

[T] In the simplest case strace runs the specified command
[T] until it exits. It intercepts and records the system
[T] calls which are called by a process and the signals which
[T] are received by a process. The name of each system call,
[T] its arguments and its return value are printed on standard
[T] error or to the file specified with the -o option.
