[T] The POCO C++ Libraries are a collection of class libraries
[T] for developing network-centric, portable applications in C++.

[T] and cover functionality like threads, thread synchronization,
[T] filesystem access, streams, shared libraries and class loading,
[T] sockets and network protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.), including
[T] an HTTP server, as well as an XML parser with SAX2 and DOM
[T] interfaces and SQL database access.
