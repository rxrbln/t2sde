[I] A simple function library optimized for various CPUs

[T] Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized
[T] for various CPUs. These functions are generally loops
[T] implementing simple algorithms, such as converting an
[T] array of N integers to floating-point numbers or multi-
[T] plying and summing an array of N numbers. Such functions
[T] are candidates for significant optimization using various
[T] techniques, especially by using extended instructions
[T] provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
