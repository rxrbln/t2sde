[I] Scientific Python

[T] ScientificPython is a collection of Python modules that are useful for
[T] scientific computing. In this collection you will find modules that
[T] cover basic geometry (vectors, tensors, transformations, vector and
[T] tensor fields), quaternions, automatic derivatives, (linear)
[T] interpolation, polynomials, elementary statistics, nonlinear
[T] least-squares fits, unit calculations, Fortran-compatible text
[T] formatting, 3D visualization via VRML, and two Tk widgets for simple
[T] line plots and 3D wireframe models. There are also interfaces to the
[T] netCDF library (portable structured binary files), to MPI (Message
[T] Passing Interface, message-based parallel programming), and to BSPlib
[T] (Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming).
