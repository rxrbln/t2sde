[I] The atomic_ops project

[T] Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations on a number
[T] of architectures. This allows direct use of these in reasonably portable
[T] code. Unlike earlier similar packages, this one explicitly considers
[T] memory barrier semantics, and allows the construction of code that
[T] involves minimum overhead across a variety of architectures.
