[I] A make-like program

[T] Boost.Jam is a portable build tool with its own interpreted language,
[T] allowing to implement rather complex logic in a readable way and without
[T] resorting to external programs. It is a descendant of Jam/MR tool modified
[T] to suit the needs of Boost.Build. In particular, modules and rule
[T] parameters were added, as well as several new builtins.
