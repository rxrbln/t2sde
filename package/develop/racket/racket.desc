[I] Racket, the Language-Oriented Programming Language

[T] Racket is a general-purpose modern Scheme dialect, implementation and
[T] ecosystem.
[T]
[T] Racket allows programmers to add new syntactic constructs in the same way
[T] that other languages permit the formulation of procedures, methods, or
[T] classes.
[T]
[T] Racket comes with a comprehensive suite of libraries: a cross-platform
[T] GUI toolbox, a web server, and more.
