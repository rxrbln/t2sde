[I] A modern replacemnt for CVS

[T] arch is a modern replacement for CVS, specifically designed for the
[T] distributed development needs of free software projects. It has uniquely
[T] good support for development on branches (especially good merging tools),
[T] distributed repositories (every developer can have branches in their own
[T] repository), changeset-oriented project management (arch commits changes
[T] to multiple files at once), and, of course, file and directory renaming.
