[I] A distributed version control system

[T] monotone is a distributed version control system with a flat
[T] peer model, cryptographic version naming, meta-data certificates,
[T] decentralized authority, and overlapping branches. It works out of
[T] a transactional version database stored in a regular file, and uses
[T] a custom network protocol for efficient database synchronization.
