[I] A Atmel USB Device Firmware Updater

[T] Dfu-programmer is an implementation of the Device Firmware Upgrade class
[T] USB driver that enables firmware upgrades for various USB enabled (with
[T] the correct bootloader) Atmel chips.  This program was created because
[T] the Atmel "FLIP" program for flashing devices does not support flashing
[T] via USB on Linux, and because standard DFU loaders do not work for
[T] Atmel's chips.
