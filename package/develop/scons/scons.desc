[I] A make-like program

[T] SCons is an Open Source software construction tool?that is, a next-
[T] generation build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform
[T] substitute for the classic Make utility with integrated functionality
[T] similar to autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short,
[T] SCons is an easier, more reliable and faster way to build software.
