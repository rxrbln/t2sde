[I] C++ library for algebraic manipulations

[T] The name GiNaC is an iterated and recursive abbreviation for GiNaC is Not
[T] a CAS, where CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. It has been developed
[T] to become a replacement engine for xloops which is up to now powered by the
[T] Maple CAS. Its design is revolutionary in a sense that contrary to other
[T] CAS it does not try to provide extensive algebraic capabilities and a
[T] simple programming language but instead accepts a given language (C++) and
[T] extends it by a set of algebraic capabilities.
