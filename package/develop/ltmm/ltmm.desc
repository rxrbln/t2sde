[I] C++ interface to libltdl

[T] For many kinds of applications, the ability of loading code into 
[T] the application dynamically (at runtime) is wanted. As C++ is 
[T] growing in popularity, that feature should be readily avaliable 
[T] to the C++ programmer. This set of headers provide such features 
[T] by wrapping the highly portable C library libltdl.
