[I] A Tool for memory profiling and leak detection

[T] MemProf is a tool for profiling memory usage and finding memory
[T] leaks. It can generate a profile showing how much memory has
[T] been allocated by each function in a program, and it can scan a
[T] program's memory and find blocks that were allocated but are no
[T] longer referenced. MemProf does not require you to recompile your
[T] programs. Unlike some similar tools, it has has a graphical frontend
[T] and is relatively easy to use.
