[I] The smallest Linux C compiler

[T] The Tiny C Compiler is small, fast, unlimited, and safe. You can compile
[T] and execute C code everywhere (e.g. , on rescue disks). It generates
[T] optimized x86 code, and can compile, assemble, and link several times
[T] faster than 'gcc -O0'. Any C dynamic library can be used directly. It
[T] includes an optional memory and bounds checker, and bounds-checked code
[T] can be mixed freely with standard code. C script is also supported--just
[T] add '#!/usr/bin/tcc' at the first line of your C source, and execute it
[T] directly from the command line.
