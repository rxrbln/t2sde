[I] A desktop presence framework

[T] Galago is a desktop presence framework, designed to transmit presence
[T] information between programs. To put it in simpler terms, it takes
[T] information on who is online and their away/idle states from an instant
[T] messenger (such as gaim) or other similar programs and lets other
[T] programs (such as Ximian's Evolution) to make use of it.
