[I] Python-powered template engine and code generator  

[T] Cheetah is a Python-powered template engine and code generator. 
[T] It can be used as a standalone utility or it can be combined with other tools. 
[T] Cheetah has many potential uses, but web developers looking for a viable 
[T] alternative to ASP, JSP, PHP and PSP are expected to be its principle user group. 
[T]
[T] Cheetah: 
[T] - generates HTML, SGML, XML, SQL, Postscript, form email, LaTeX, or any other 
[T]   text-based format. 
[T] - cleanly separates content, graphic design, and program code. This leads to 
[T]   highly modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures, shorter development 
[T]   time, and HTML and program code that is easier to understand and maintain. 
[T]   It is particularly well suited for team efforts. 
[T] - blends the power and flexibility of Python with a simple template language 
[T]   that non-programmers can understand. 
[T] - gives template writers full access to any Python data structure, module, 
[T]   function, object, or method in their templates. 
[T] - makes code reuse easy by providing an object-orientated interface to templates 
[T]   that is accessible from Python code or other Cheetah templates. One template 
[T]   can subclass another and selectively reimplement sections of it. 
[T] - provides a simple, yet powerful, caching mechanism that can dramatically 
[T]   improve the performance of a dynamic website. 
[T] - compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.
