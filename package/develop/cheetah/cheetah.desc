[I] Python-powered template engine and code generator

[T] Cheetah is a Python-powered template engine and code generator.
[T] It can be used as a standalone utility or it can be combined with other tools.
[T] Cheetah has many potential uses, but web developers looking for a viable
[T] alternative to ASP, JSP, PHP and PSP are expected to be its principle user group.
[T]
[T] Cheetah:
[T] - generates HTML, SGML, XML, SQL, Postscript, form email, LaTeX, or any other
[T] text-based format.
[T] - cleanly separates content, graphic design, and program code. This leads to
[T] highly modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures, shorter development
[T] time, and HTML and program code that is easier to understand and maintain.
[T] It is particularly well suited for team efforts.
[T] - blends the power and flexibility of Python with a simple template language
[T] that non-programmers can understand.
[T] - gives template writers full access to any Python data structure, module,
[T] function, object, or method in their templates.
[T] - makes code reuse easy by providing an object-orientated interface to templates
[T] that is accessible from Python code or other Cheetah templates. One template
[T] can subclass another and selectively reimplement sections of it.
[T] - provides a simple, yet powerful, caching mechanism that can dramatically
[T] improve the performance of a dynamic website.
[T] - compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.
