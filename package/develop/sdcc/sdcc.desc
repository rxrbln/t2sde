[I] Retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler for the 8051 MCU

[T] SDCC is a freeware, retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler. The
[T] current version targets Intel 8051-based MCUs, the Zilog Z80, and the
[T] DS390. Targets for the Microchip PIC and Amtel AVR series are under
[T] development, and the compiler can be retargeted for other 8 bit MCUs
[T] or PICs.
[T] SDCC has extensive MCU (8051)-specific language extensions, which lets
[T] it utilize the underlying hardware effectively. It includes a
[T] source-level debugger/simulator and can generate debug info for the
[T] NoICE debugger.
