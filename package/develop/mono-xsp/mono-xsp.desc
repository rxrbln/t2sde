[I] Small web server for running what is known as ASP.NET

[T] The XSP server is a small web server that hosts the Mono
[T] System.Web classes for running what is commonly known as ASP.NET.
[T] ASP.NET provides the platform to run web applications and web
[T] services, and provides a number of hooks that allows the user to
[T] host it on applications or other web servers.
[T]
[T] If you are interested in hosting the ASP.NET classes for
[T] higher performance in an Apache module or your favorite web
[T] server, you could use the code in this module as a starting point
[T] for it. See mod_mono.
