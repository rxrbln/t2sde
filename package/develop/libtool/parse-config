		#   removed by the sed expression
		# 2. Wrong quotes around sed expression
		#   A cleanup routine for temporary paths (grep for notinst_path) in libtool*/ltmain.* removes
		#   paths that should not appear after installation of the library. For this to work the "$path"
		#   variable must be evaluated (which is not possible with ' around it)
		# 3. Sed expects a leading whitespace
		#   To be sure that the cleaning process (mentioned in 2.) works also for the first argument,
		#   a " " is prepended before it is run through the sed expression (see 2.).
