[I] Elegant C++ backtraces

[T] The libebt library provides a clean way of getting human-readable
[T] backtrace messages in C++. It uses the RAII (resource acquisition is
[T] initialization) idiom to manage backtrace stack items without requiring
[T] macros, control structures, or an external debugger.
