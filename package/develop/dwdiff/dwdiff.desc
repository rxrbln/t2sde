[I] Diff program operating at the word level

[T] Dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level instead of the
[T] line level. It allows the user to set what should be considered
[T] whitespace and delimiters as opposed to gnu wdiff.
[T] Dwdiff is mostly commandline compatible with wdiff.
