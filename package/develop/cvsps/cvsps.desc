[I] A supplemental tool to CVS that provides patchset information

[T] CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS
[T] repository. A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes made to
[T] a collection of files, and all committed at the same time (using a single
[T] 'cvs commit' command). This information is valuable to seeing the big
[T] picture of the evolution of a cvs project. CVSps allows you to see history
[T] of committed patchsets, restrict by author, date range, files affected,
[T] branches affected. CVSps can generate a diff of a given patchset.
