[I] A terminal I/O library similar in some respects to curses

[T] Vtoo is a terminal input, output, and control library that works with GNU
[T] compilers, and may or may not work with other compilers. Unlike curses,
[T] it doesn't use termcap databases or any sort of terminal-detection and
[T] abstraction routines. Vtoo supports colors and text styling attributes,
[T] positioning, window change handlers, streamlined single character input
[T] validation, text wrapping and alignment, working width/height detection,
[T] and an elegant stack-based screen/window management system that includes
[T] routines for decorated windows.
