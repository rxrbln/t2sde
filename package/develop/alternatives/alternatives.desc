[I] Alternatives system 

[T] It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or 
[T] similar functions to be installed on a single system at the 
[T] same time. For example, many systems have several text editors 
[T] installed at once. This gives choice to the users of a system, 
[T] allowing each to use a  different editor, if desired, but makes 
[T] it difficult for a program to make a good choice of editor to 
[T] invoke if the user has not specified a particular preference.
