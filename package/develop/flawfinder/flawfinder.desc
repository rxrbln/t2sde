[I] A program that scans source code looking for security weaknesses

[T] Flawfinder searches through source code looking for potential
[T] security flaws. It will provide a list of potential security flaws,
[T] sorted by risk, with the most potentially dangerous flaws shown
[T] first. This risk level depends not only on the function, but on
[T] the values of the parameters of the function. Flawfinder ignores
[T] text inside comments and strings.
