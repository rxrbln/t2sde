[I] A versatile cross-referencing tool for relatively large code repositories

[T] The Linux Cross-Reference project is the testbed application of a general
[T] hypertext cross-referencing tool. Its main goal is to create a versatile
[T] cross-referencing tool for relatively large code repositories. The main
[T] feature of the indexer is the ability to jump easily to the declaration
[T] of any global identifier. Quick access to function declarations, data
[T] (type) definitions and preprocessor macros makes code browsing more
[T] convenient. At-a-glance overview of which code areas will be affected
[T] by changing a function or type definition should also come in useful
[T] during development and debugging.
