[I] A virtual machine for all dynamic languages

[T] Parrot is a virtual machine designed from scratch to support dynamic
[T] languages, including Perl 6, Perl 5, Python, Ruby, Tcl, and many
[T] others. Parrot was born from the Perl 6 development effort, but currently
[T] treats Perl 6 as only one of its many client languages.
