[I] A virtual machine for all dynamic languages

[T] Parrot is a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and execute
[T] bytecode for dynamic languages. Parrot currently hosts a variety of
[T] language implementations in various stages of completion, including Tcl,
[T] Javascript, Ruby, Lua, Scheme, PHP, Python, Perl 6, APL, and a .NET
[T] bytecode translator.
[T]
[T] Parrot was born from the Perl 6 development effort, but currently
[T] treats Perl 6 as only one of its many client languages.
