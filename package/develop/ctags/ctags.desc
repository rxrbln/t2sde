[I] Sourcefile indexer

[T] Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the much-underused
[T] ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of all ctags programs. It
[T] generates indexes of source code definitions which are used by a number of
[T] editors and tools. The motivation which drove the development of Exuberant
[T] Ctags was the need for a ctags program which supported generation of tags
[T] for all possible C language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and
[T] because most were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.
