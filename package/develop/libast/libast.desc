[I] A multi-purpose utility library

[T] The Library of Assorted Spiffy Things (LibAST - formerly libmej)
[T] was originally designed as a companion library to Eterm.
[T] However, it contains many features that other projects may find
[T] useful, so it has been broken out into its own library. Features
[T] [T] include thorough debugging and memory tracking engines,
[T] various string manipulation functions, and a flexible config
[T] file parsing engine.
