[I] A library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching FSTs

[T] OpenFst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and
[T] searching weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs). Weighted
[T] finite-state transducers are automata where each transition has an
[T] input label, an output label, and a weight.
[T]
[T] FSTs have key applications in speech recognition and synthesis, machine
[T] translation, optical character recognition, pattern matching, string
[T] processing, machine learning, information extraction and retrieval
[T] among others.
