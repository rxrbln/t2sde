[I] A library for attaching XDP programs and using AF_XDP sockets

[T] Libxdp provides two primary features on top of libbpf. The first is the
[T] ability to load multiple XDP programs in sequence on a single network
[T] device (which is not natively supported by the kernel). This support
[T] relies on the freplace functionality in the kernel, which makes it
[T] possible to attach an eBPF program as a replacement for a global function
[T] in another (already loaded) eBPF program. The second main feature is
[T] helper functions for configuring AF_XDP sockets as well as reading and
[T] writing packets from these sockets.
