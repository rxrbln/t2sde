[I] A library for parallel events and asynchronous tasking

[T] The PEAK library tries to achieve high performance in combining
[T] multi-threading with an efficient I/O event model. You can write
[T] event-based applications that use massive sockets I/O, timers, and
[T] signals. Its underlying I/O multiplexing engine supports kqueue(2)
[T] (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Mac OS X), epoll(2) (Linux 2. 6), and /dev/poll
[T] (Solaris). It provides support for optimized memory allocations, basic
[T] database primitives, and synchronization.
