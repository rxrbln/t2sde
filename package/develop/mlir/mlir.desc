[I] Multi-Level Intermediate Representation

[T] The MLIR project is a novel approach to building reusable and extensible
[T] compiler infrastructure. MLIR aims to address software fragmentation,
[T] improve compilation for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce the
[T] cost of building domain specific compilers, and aid in connecting existing
[T] compilers together.
