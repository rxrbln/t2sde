[I] A scripting language for C programmers

[T] Nesla is a complete object-based scripting language written in just
[T] a few thousand lines of ANSI C. It's portable, thread-safe, flexible,
[T] embeddable, expandable, and easy to understand (as a language and as
[T] an API). Nesla scripts can and often do look very much like JavaScript,
[T] but Nesla is Not an ECMA Scripting Language.
