[I] TLS/SSL Support for Lua

[T] LuaSec is a binding for OpenSSL library to provide TLS/SSL communication.
[T] This version delegates to LuaSocket the TCP connection establishment
[T] between the client and server, and, since the connection is performed,
[T] it is used to start a secure TLS/SSL session.
