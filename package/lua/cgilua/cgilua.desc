[I] A Lua tool for creating dynamic Web pages

[T] CGILua is a tool for creating dynamic Web pages and manipulating
[T] input data from Web forms. CGILua allows the separation of logic
[T] and data handling from the generation of pages, making it ease
[T] to develop web applications with Lua. One of advantages of CGILua
[T] is its abstraction of the underlying Web server. You can develop
[T] a CGILua application for one Web server and run it on any other
[T] Web server that supports CGILua.
