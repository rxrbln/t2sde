[I] An SQLite 3 binding for Lua

[T] Lua-Sqlite3 is a binding of SQLite 3 for Lua. It is unique in contrast
[T] to other database bindings that it consists of two layers. The first
[T] layer translates the SQLite 3 implementation's C API to Lua. The second
[T] layers are interface layers, written in Lua. These layers provide a nice
[T] and smart view of the database.
