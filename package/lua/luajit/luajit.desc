[I] A Just-In-Time Compiler for the Lua programming language

[T] LuaJIT is based on the Lua 5.1.x virtual machine and bytecode interpreter
[T] from lua.org. It compiles bytecode to native x86 (i386+) machine code to
[T] speed up the execution of Lua programs. 
[T]
[T] LuaJIT depends on Coco to allow yielding from coroutines for JIT compiled
[T] functions. Coco is part of the LuaJIT distribution.
