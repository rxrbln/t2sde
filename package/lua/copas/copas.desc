[I] A Lua dispatcher that can be used fo TCP/IP socket communication

[T] Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by
[T] TCP/IP socket request/response servers. It uses LuaSocket as the
[T] interface with the TCP/IP stack.
[T] A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for
[T] requests and use Copas socket functions to send the response.
[T] Copas loops through requests and invokes the corresponding
[T] handlers.
