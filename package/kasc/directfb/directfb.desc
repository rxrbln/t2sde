[I]  direct framebuffer access library

[T] DirectFB is a thin library that provides hardware graphics 
[T] acceleration, input device handling and abstraction, integrated 
[T] windowing system with support for translucent windows and multiple 
[T] display layers on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device. It is a 
[T] complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for 
[T] every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying 
[T] hardware. DirectFB adds graphical power to embedded systems and 
[T] sets a new standard for graphics under Linux. more...
