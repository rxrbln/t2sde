[I] Kill as many targets as possible with timelimit

[T] Barrage is a rather violent action game with the objective to kill 
[T] and destroy as many targets as possible within 3 minutes. The player 
[T] controls a gun that may fire small and large grenades by ''point and 
[T] click'' at soldiers, jeeps and tanks while it must be reloaded from 
[T] time to time.
[T] As the vehicles are fast and shots take a bit of time to hit the 
[T] target position it is not that easy to get high scores.
