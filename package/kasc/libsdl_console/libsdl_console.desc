[I] a drop-down console window for SDL programs

[T] This is a console that can be added to any SDL application. It is 
[T] similar to Quake and other game consoles but with lots of added 
[T] features. A console is meant to be a very simple way of interacting 
[T] with a program and executing commands. Commands are linked to the 
[T] console with callback functions so that when a command is typed in, 
[T] a specific function is executed automatically.
