[I] Mah Jong

[T] This is a set of three programs which provide a networked Mah Jong 
[T] program, together with a computer player. Thus the game can be played 
[T] by four humans, by a human and three computer players, or any other 
[T] combination. There is a server program, which handles the game - only 
[T] one game, since I'm not trying to compete with Yahoo! and friends -, an 
[T] X client to allow humans to play naturally, and a computer player. The 
[T] version of Mah Jong is that generally called Chinese Classical. Of 
[T] course, there are many variants within this; I intend to accommodate 
[T] most of the more interesting variants via options, but this is future 
[T] work. In the longer term, I might also be interested in adding Hong Kong 
[T] and Japanese versions. I'm not interested in adding American versions, 
[T] though somebody else might be.
