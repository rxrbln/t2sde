[I] a Panzer General clone

[T] LGeneral is a turn-based strategy engine heavily inspired by Panzer 
[T] General. You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn 
[T] against a human player or the AI. Entrenchment, rugged defense, 
[T] defensive fire, surprise contacts, surrender, unit supply, weather 
[T] influence, reinforcements and other implementations contribute to 
[T] the tactical and strategic depth of the game.
