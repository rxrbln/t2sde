[I] a graphics primitive toolkit for SDL

[T] The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code which 
[T] provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or polygons 
[T] and SDL_rotozoom which implemented a interpolating rotozoomer for 
[T] SDL surfaces.
[T] 
[T] The current components of the SDL_gfx library are:
[T] 
[T] - Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)
[T] - Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h)
[T] - Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h)
[T] - MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h)
[T]
[T] The library is backwards compatible to the above mentioned code. Its 
[T] is written in plain C and can be used in C++ code.
