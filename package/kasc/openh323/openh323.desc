[I] Multi-platform class library + Open H.323 lib

[T] PWLib is a moderately large class library that has its genesis many 
[T] years ago as a method to product applications to run on both 
[T] Microsoft Windows and Unix X-Windows systems. It also was to have a 
[T] Macintosh port as well but this never eventuated.
[T]
[T] Since then the system has grown to having quite good application to 
[T] areas other than mere Windows GUI portability. Classes for I/O 
[T] portability, multi-threading portability, aid in producing unix 
[T] daemons and NT services portably and all sorts of internet protocols 
[T] were added over the years.
[T]
[T] All this over and above basic "container" classes such as arrays, 
[T] linear lists, sorted lists (RB Tree) and dictionaries (hash tables) 
[T] which were all created before STL became the answer to all our prayers. 
[T] Unfortunately, due to intertia and the GNU C++ inadequate support of 
[T] templates, this library will probably not be ported to STL in the near 
[T] future.
[T] 
[T] The library was used extensively for all our in-house products. Then 
[T] we decided to support the open H323 project by throwing in some of the 
[T] code written for one of our products. Thus, required PWLib so it got 
[T] thrown into the open source world as well.
