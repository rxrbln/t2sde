[I] The printer administration tool in Fedora 6 (and later)

[T] The purpose of the tool is to configure a CUPS server (often the local
[T] machine) using the CUPS API. The tool is written in Python, using pygtk
[T] for the graphical parts and with some Python bindings (pycups) for the
[T] CUPS API.
[T] It is largely the same as using the CUPS web interface for configuring
[T] printers, but has the advantage of being a native application rather than
[T] a web page.
[T] As a result of using the CUPS API the tool is able to configure remote
[T] CUPS instances and is not limited to configuring CUPS on the local
[T] machine. The CUPS library providing the API uses HTTP and IPP to
[T] communicate with the CUPS server.
