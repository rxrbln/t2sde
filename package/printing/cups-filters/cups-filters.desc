[I] Backends, filters, and other software that was once part of the core CUPS

[T] This project provides backends, filters, and other software that was once
[T] part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained by Apple
[T] Inc. In addition it contains additional filters and software developed
[T] independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric printing
[T] workflow introduced by OpenPrinting.
[T] From CUPS 1.6.0 on, this package is required for printing.
