[I] X Printing Panel

[T] The X Printing Panel (XPP) is a completely free tool for easy
[T] choosing of the desired printer out of a list of all available
[T] printers and for setting printer options by an easy-to-use
[T] graphical user interface. One simply calls the program (xpp)
[T] instead of the usual utilities (lpr or lp) at the command line
[T] or out of applications.
