For some reason the latest make (3.81) invokes the shell via a child make
instance when the SHELL variable is set to a quoted string and thus messes
up quoting:

 execve("/usr/bin/make", ["make", "testme"], [/* 22 vars */]) = 0
-execve("/bin/sh", ["/bin/sh", "-c", "for x in a b c ; do \\\n   echo \"$"...],
[/* 25 vars */]) = 0
+execve("/bin/sh", ["/bin/sh", "-c", "\"/bin/sh\" -c for\\ x\\ in\\ a\\ b\\ c"...], [/* 25 vars */]) = 0
+execve("/bin/sh", ["/bin/sh", "-c", "for x in a b c ; do \\"], [/* 24 vars */]) = 0
