[I] Next Generation Line-Printer-Spooler

[T] LPRng is the Next Generation in LPR software. It supports the standard
[T] bsd lpr commands and also supports an System V interface. Other features
[T] include lightweight lpr, lpc, and lprm programs, dynamic redirection of
[T] print queues, automatic job holding, highly verbose diagnostics, multiple
[T] printers serving a single queue, client programs do not need to run SUID
[T] root, greatly enhanced security checks and a greatly improved permission
[T] and authorization mechanism. The default configuration provides a simple
[T] BSD LPR interface, but there are options to modify a wide variety of
[T] operational facilities. The companion IFHP print filter can interface to a
[T] wide variety of printers, from the latest network based high speed to
[T] vintage legacy printers.
