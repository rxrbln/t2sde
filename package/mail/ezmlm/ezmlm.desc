[I] An easy-to-use, high-speed mailing list manager for qmail.

[T] ezmlm lets users set up their own mailing lists within
[T] qmail's address hierarchy. A user, Joe, types ``ezmlm-make
[T] ~/SOS ~/.qmail-sos joe-sos isp.net'' and instantly has a
[T] functioning mailing list, joe-sos@isp.net, with all relevant
[T] information stored in a new ~/SOS directory.
[T]
[T] ezmlm-idx extension:
[T] It adds multi-message threaded message retrieval from the archive,
[T] digests, message and subscription moderation, and a number of
[T] remote administration function. It modifies the configuration
[T] program ezmlm-make so that it uses a text file template rather
[T] than compiled-in texts in list creation. In this manner, ezmlm-idx
[T] allows easy setup of lists in different languages and
[T] customization of default list setup. ezmlm-idx also adds MIME
[T] handling, and other support to streamline use with languages other
[T] than English. As an ezmlm add-on, ezmlm-idx does not work without
[T] ezmlm and tries to be compatible with ezmlm as much as possible.
[T] ezmlm-idx also modifies the ezmlm subscriber database to be case
[T] insensitive to avoid many unsubscribe problems.
