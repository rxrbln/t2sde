[I] MIME file extractor

[T] ripMIME has been written as part of the (commercial) Xamime package, but
[T] because there was such a problem trying to attain a easy to use, openSource
[T] MIME decoder which the everyday person with some limited C skills could try
[T] and play with, we decided to release the MIME decoding components of Xamime
[T] as its own package which you are now seeing as "ripMIME".
[T]
[T] ripMIME has a single sole pupose, to extract the attached files out of a
[T] MIME package (as say produced by programs such as AMaViS, Inflex and
[T] Xamime). ripMIME deliberately has no other operating purpose (if you
[T] find another use, then that's great).
[T]
[T] ripMIME has been written (at this point) purely by Paul L Daniels, it is
[T] being released under a BSD style licence so that other commercial ventures
[T] may if they so desire use this product without the headaches normally
[T] associated with using GPL software.
