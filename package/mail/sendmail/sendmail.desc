[I] Electronic mail transport agent

[T] Sendmail implements a  general purpose internetwork  mail routing facility
[T] under the  UNIX(R) operating system.   It is not tied to any one transport
[T] protocol  its  function may  be  likened  to a crossbar switch,   relaying
[T] messages from one domain into another. In the process, it can do a limited
[T] amount of message header  editing to put the message into a format that is
[T] appropriate for  the receiving  domain.    All of  this is  done under the
[T] control of a configuration file. ...Due to the requirements of flexibility
[T] for the configuration file can seem somewhat unapproachable.      However,
[T] there are only  a few basic  configurations  for most sites,     for which
[T] standard configuration files have been supplied. Most other configurations
[T] can be built by adjusting an existing configuration file incrementally.
[T]
[T] Read /etc/mail/README or the O'Reilly book for details on configuring
[T] sendmail.
