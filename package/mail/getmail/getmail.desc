[I] A fetchmail replacement with qmail-like Maildir and external MDA delivery

[T] Getmail is intended as a simple, secure, and reliable replacement for
[T] fetchmail. It retrieves email (either all messages, or only unread
[T] messages) from one or more POP3, SPDS, or IMAP4 servers (with or
[T] without SSL) for one or more email accounts, and reliably delivers into
[T] qmail-style Maildirs, mboxrd files, or through external MDAs (command
[T] deliveries) specified on a per-account basis. Getmail also has excellent
[T] support for domain (multidrop) mailboxes, including delivering messages to
[T] different users or destinations based on the envelope recipient address.
