[I] A controllable regex mutilator and antispam filter

[T] CRM114 is a Controllable Regex Mutilator and Smart Filter, 
[T] designed for easy creation of filters for things like incoming 
[T] email redirection, spam filtering, system logs, or monitoring 
[T] processes. Filtering rules can be either hard-coded (such as 
[T] regexes), soft-coded (calculated at runtime or read from an 
[T] external file or process), or learned dynamically by phrase 
[T] matching (by SBPH hashing). This makes it possible to create 
[T] very accurate filters with very little actual work.  Accuracies 
[T] over 99.9% are achievable.
