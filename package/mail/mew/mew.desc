[I] Message client for Emacs

[T] Mew is an interface to integrate
[T] 
[T]    - Email
[T]    - NetNews
[T]    - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
[T]    - PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
[T] 
[T] and to make it easy to view and compose them. With Mew you can send a
[T] picture of a birthday cake with the song "Happy Birthday to you" to your
[T] friend, which is encrypted by strong cryptograph.
[T] 
[T] Mew is an acronym of "Messaging in the Emacs World". You should spell it
[T] with the first letter capitalized and pronounce it as it is(i.e. meow of
[T] cats). When the author started programming it, he chose a cute word from
[T] his English dictionary. So, Mew.
[T] 
[T] Mew is officially supposed to run on Emacs 19.28, 19.34, and 20.3 or
[T] later, Mule 2.3 or later, and XEmacs 20.4 or later. Emacs other than
[T] described, such as Emacs 18, Nemacs, Mule 1, and XEmacs 19 and 20.3 are
[T] not and will not be supported in the future. Mew may support beta
[T] versions of Emacs but Mew conforms the spec of official release when
[T] available.
