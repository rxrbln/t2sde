[I] A sendmail-like command that feeds its stdin to SMTP relays

[T] Mini_sendmail reads its standard input up to an end-of-file and sends
[T] a copy of the message found there to all of the addresses listed. The
[T] message is sent by connecting to a local SMTP server. This means
[T] mini_sendmail can be used to send email from inside a chrooted area.
