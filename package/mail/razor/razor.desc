[I] A spam detection and filtering network

[T] Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and
[T] filtering network that exploits the broadcast characteristic of spam
[T] distribution to limit its propagation. The primary focus of the system
[T] is to identify and disable an email spam before its injection and
[T] processing is complete. Razor establishes a distributed and constantly
[T] updating catalogue of spam in propagation. This catalogue is used by
[T] clients to filter out known spam.
