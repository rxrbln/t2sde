[I] Courier Authentication Library

[T] The Courier Authentication Library is a generic authentication
[T] API that encapsulates the process of validating account passwords.
[T] In addition to reading the traditional account passwords from
[T] /etc/passwd, the account information can alternatively be obtained
[T] from an LDAP directory; a MySQL or a PostgreSQL database; or a GDBM
[T] or a DB file. The Courier authentication library must be installed
[T] before building any Courier packages that needs direct access to
[T] mailboxes (in other words, all packages except for courier-sox
[T] and courier-analog).
