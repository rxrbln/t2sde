[T] mess822 is a library for parsing Internet mail messages. The mess822
[T] package contains several applications that work with qmail:
[T]
[T] * ofmipd rewrites messages from dumb clients. It supports a database
[T]   of recognized senders and From lines, using cdb for fast lookups.

[T]   includes a flexible user-controlled hostname rewriting mechanism.
[T] * iftocc can be used in .qmail files. It checks whether a known
[T]   address is listed in To or Cc.
[T] * 822header, 822field, 822date, and 822received extract various pieces
[T]   of information from a mail message.
