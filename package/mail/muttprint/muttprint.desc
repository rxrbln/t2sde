[I] Pretty mail printing for your mailreader

[T] Muttprint is a utility that formats the printing of Mutt and other 
[T] mail clients like XFMail or PINE to be like the printing of Netscape 
[T] Messenger or Kmail. It can print a little penguin on the first page and 
[T] a headline on every page. Furthermore, it only prints the most important 
[T] headers, but not the whole plethora of them.
