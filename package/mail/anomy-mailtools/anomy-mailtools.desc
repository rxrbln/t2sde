[I] An email vulnerability protector and sanitizer

[T] The Anomy sanitizer is what most people would call "an email virus
[T] scanner". That description is not totally accurate, but it does cover
[T] one of the more important jobs that the sanitizer can do for you - it
[T] can scan email attachments for viruses. Other things it can do:
[T] 
[T]     * Disable potentially dangerous HTML code, such as javascript, 
[T]       within incoming email.
[T] 
[T]     * Protect you from email-based break-in attempts which exploit bugs 
[T]       in common email programs (Outlook, Eudora, ..).
[T] 
[T]     * Block or "mangle" attachments based on their file names. This way 
[T]       if you don't *need* to recieve e.g. visual basic scripts, then you
[T]       don't have to worry about the security risk they imply. This lets
[T]       you protect yourself and your users from whole classes of attacks,
[T]       without relying on complex, resource intensive and outdated virus
[T]       scanning solutions.
