[I] An email vulnerability protector and sanitizer

[T] The Anomy sanitizer is what most people would call "an email virus
[T] scanner". That description is not totally accurate, but it does cover
[T] one of the more important jobs that the sanitizer can do for you - it
[T] can scan email attachments for viruses. Other things it can do:
[T]
[T] * Disable potentially dangerous HTML code, such as javascript,
[T] within incoming email.
[T]
[T] * Protect you from email-based break-in attempts which exploit bugs
[T] in common email programs (Outlook, Eudora, ..).
[T]
[T] * Block or "mangle" attachments based on their file names. This way
[T] if you don't *need* to recieve e.g. visual basic scripts, then you
[T] don't have to worry about the security risk they imply. This lets
[T] you protect yourself and your users from whole classes of attacks,
[T] without relying on complex, resource intensive and outdated virus
[T] scanning solutions.
