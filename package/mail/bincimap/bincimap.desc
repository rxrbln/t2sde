[I] A well designed, modular IMAP server for Maildir written in C++

[T] Binc IMAP is a well designed, modular IMAP server for Maildir. Its goals
[T] are to be secure, stable, and fast, yet flexible and easy to maintain.
[T]
[T] For those familiar with qmail-pop3d, this IMAP server will be the natural
[T] choice. It is invoked similarily and uses checkpassword to authenticate.
[T]
[T] Binc IMAP 1.2 is a Maildir only IMAP server (no traditional mbox support).
[T] However, future versions are likely to support a variety of mailbox types.
