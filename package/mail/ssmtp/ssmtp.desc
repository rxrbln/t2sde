[I] Extremely simple MTA

[T] A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail
[T] hub. It contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no mail spool
[T] to poke around in, and no daemons running in the background. Mail is simply
[T] forwarded to the configured mailhost. Extremely easy configuration.
[T]
[T] WARNING: the above is all it does; it does not receive mail, expand aliases
[T] or manage a queue. That belongs on a mail hub with a system administrator.
