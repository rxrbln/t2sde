[I] A distributed spam filter

[T] Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (DCC) is a system of clients and
[T] servers that collect and count checksums related to mail messages. The
[T] counts can be used by SMTP servers and mail user agents to detect and
[T] reject bulk mail. DCC servers can exchange common checksums. The
[T] checksums include values that are "fuzzy", or constant across common
[T] variations in bulk messages.
