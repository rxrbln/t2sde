[I] Simple relay-only mail transport agent

[T] Nullmailer is a mail transport agent designed to only relay all its
[T] messages through a fixed set of "upstream" hosts. It is also designed to
[T] be secure and to be used as a simple sendmail/qmail/etc. replacement.
[T] The localqueue patch allows this MTA to send all local mail to a local
[T] mbox instead of being sent through network to an administration email.
