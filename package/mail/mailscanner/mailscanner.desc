[I] An email virus scanner, vulnerability protector, and spam handler

[T] MailScanner is an email virus scanner, vulnerability protector, and spam 
[T] tagger. It supports the Postfix, Sendmail, Exim and ZMailer MTAs, and 
[T] the Sophos, McAfee, F-Prot, F-Secure, CommandAV, InoculateIT, Inoculan 
[T] 4.x, Kaspersky, Nod32, AntiVir, RAV, Panda, and Clam anti-virus 
[T] scanners. It supports SpamAssassin for highly successful spam 
[T] identification. It is specifically designed to handle denial of service 
[T] attacks. It is very easy to install, and requires no changes at all to 
[T] your sendmail.cf file. It is designed to be lightweight, and won't grind 
[T] your mail system to a halt with its load; a good PC can process over 1.5 
[T] million messages per day. It can be integrated into any email system, 
[T] regardless of the software in use.
