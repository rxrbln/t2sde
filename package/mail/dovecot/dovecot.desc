[I] A secure IMAP server

[T] Dovecot is an IMAP server whose major goals are security and extreme
[T] reliability. It uses index files to optimally store the mailbox state,
[T] which makes it very fast even with huge mailboxes. Indexes won't prevent
[T] external mailbox updates, so Dovecot is still fully compatible with
[T] standard Maildir and mbox formats. There's also a fully featured POP3
[T] server included.
