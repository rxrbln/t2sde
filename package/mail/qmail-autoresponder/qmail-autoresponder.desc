[I] Rate-limited autoresponder for qmail

[T] This is a simple program to automatically respond to emails.
[T]
[T] It is based on some ideas (but little or no code) from a similar
[T] autoresponder by Eric Huss, and ideas presented on the qmail mailing list.
[T]
[T] Features:
[T] - Limits rate of automatic responses (defaults to a maximum of one
[T]   message every hour).
[T] - Will not respond to nearly every type of mailing list or bulk email.
[T] - Will not respond to bounce messages or MAILER-DAEMON.
[T] - Bounces looping messages.
[T] - Can insert the original subject into the response.
[T] - Can copy original message into response.
[T] - Can use links in the rate-limiting data directory to limit inode usage
[T]   to a single inode.
