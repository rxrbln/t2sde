[I] Web Browser for the Terminal

[T] Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
[T] cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100 terminals,
[T] vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes, or any other
[T] character-cell display.  It will display Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
[T] documents containing links to files on the local system, as well as files on
[T] remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp, finger, or cso/ph/qi
[T] servers, and services accessible via logins to telnet, tn3270 or rlogin
[T] accounts.
[T] 
[T] This version of lynx is built with the SSL-MM patch which enables support
[T] for HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) and NNTP over SSL (SNEWS). SSL is handled
[T] transparently, allowing users to continue accessing web sites and news
[T] services from within Lynx through the same interface for both secure and
[T] standard transfers.
