[I] A tool for network CD/DVD writing

[T] webCDwriter can be used to make the CD- and DVD-writer(s)
[T] connected to a Linux box available to all users in your network. It
[T] consists of the server CDWserver and the clients webCDcreator
[T] and rcdrecord. CDWserver stores the files transmitted by the
[T] clients, reserves the CD-writer and controls the CD-writer using
[T] cdrecord. webCDcreator is a Java applet that runs within your
[T] browser or by Java Web Start, assists you when putting together a
[T] CD, and transmits the files. Finally rcdrecord is a command line
[T] client that tries to offer the functionality of cdrecord over the
[T] network with full multi-user support.
