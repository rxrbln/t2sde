[I] A unix command line interface to various search engines

[T] Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get on
[T] with what it is good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic forms
[T] is handed back to the shell, which is what it, and human beings are good
[T] at. Combined with netscape-remote or incremental text browsers, such as
[T] lynx, links or w3m, along with screen a Surfraw liberateur is capable of
[T] navigating speeds that leave GUI tainted idolaters agape with fear and
[T] wonder.
