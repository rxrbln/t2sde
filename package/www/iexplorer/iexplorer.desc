[I] Microsoft Internet Explorer

[T] This package is heavily based on ies4linux bash script, which allows
[T] installing completely behind the scenes! without needing to click on
[T] anything to install IE6 - with FlashPlayer 8!
[T]
[T] This is possible because Evolt Browser Archive exists. They offer
[T] complete IE downloads, so we can skip all that boring installation
[T] process. We also download some Microsoft corrections directly from
[T] microsoft.com.
[T]
[T] All these files are compressed using Microsoft CAB format. So we
[T] strongly need cabextract utility. We just cabextract the packages,
[T] copy the files to the right places and copy the proper wine reg files.
