[I] A PHP accelerator, optimizer, encoder and dynamic content cache

[T] eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, encoder and
[T] dynamic content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by
[T] caching them in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is
[T] almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their
[T] execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the
[T] speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.
[T]
[T] eAccelerator was born in December 2004 as a fork of the Turck MMCache
[T] project. Turck MMCache was created by Dmitry Stogov and much of the
[T] eAccelerator code is still based on his work.
[T]
[T] eAccelerator stores compiled PHP scripts in shared memory and executes code
[T] directly from it. It creates locks only for a short time, while searching
[T] for a compiled PHP script in the cache, so one script can be executed
[T] simultaneously by several engines. Files that can't fit in shared memory
[T] are cached on disk only.
[T]
[T] eAccelerator also contains a PHP encoder and loader. You can encode PHP
[T] scripts using encoder.php in order to distribute them without sources.
[T] Encoded files can be run on any site which runs PHP with eAccelerator.
[T] The sources of encoded scripts can't be restored because they are stored
[T] in a compiled form and the encoded version doesn't contain the source. Of
[T] course, some internals of the scripts can be restored with different reverse
[T] engineering tools (disassemblers, debuggers, etc.), but it is not trivial.
