It got on my nerves for some time that I have to compute the resulting width and
height manually all the itme - a task screaming for a computer. Also just
cutting off the overscan noise usually on DVB broadcasts requires multiple
parameter sets depending on the actual broadcast format (e.g. classic 4:3
vs. a real (black border-less) 16:9) transmission).

Allow relative cuts using negative values, e.g. crop="20:82:-20:-82".
