[I] DVB tuner daemon

[T] This daemon allows maximum use of DVB cards by allowing multiple channels
[T] on the same frequency to be tuned. It is split into a daemon (dvbd) and
[T] client programs (dvbcat, dvbsched, dvblist). It is possible to associate
[T] a priority with a connection to the daemon, so that (depending on the
[T] given priority) the tuner can be made available by dropping connections
[T] inferior priority.
