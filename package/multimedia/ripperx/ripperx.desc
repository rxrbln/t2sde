[I] Yet another CD ripping application

[T] RipperX is a pretty GTK program to rip CD audio and encode to Ogg, MP3,
[T] or other sound formats. It is easy, usually requiring no more three
[T] mouse clicks to convert an entire album, while nicely displaying the
[T] progress along the way. It can rip and encode in parallel and has
[T] plugins for cdparanoia, Oggenc, Lame, FLAC, and others. It also has
[T] support for CDDB (including HTTP proxy servers) for automatic track
[T] name query and setting ID tags.
