[I] Share a single keyboard and mouse between multiple computers

[T] Deskflow is a keyboard and mouse sharing app. Use the keyboard, mouse, or
[T] trackpad of one computer to control nearby computers, and work seamlessly
[T] between them. It's like a software KVM (but without the video). TLS
[T] encryption is enabled by default. Wayland is supported. Clipboard sharing
[T] is supported.
