[I] A Flash rendering library

[T] Swfdec is a library for rendering Flash animations and games. It was
[T] originally designed to be used for creating Flash plugins for GStreamer,
[T] but is a fully standalone library that only requires the libart library
[T] for drawing. It includes a GTK+ player (swf_play) and a Mozilla plug-in.
