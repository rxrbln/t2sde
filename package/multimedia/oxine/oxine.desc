[I] A purely OSD-based xine frontend

[T] oxine is a lightweight, purely OSD-based xine frontend for set-top
[T] boxes and home entertainment systems. It uses the on screen display
[T] functionality of xine to display its user interface elements like
[T] buttons, lists, sliders, and so on. Due to this, oxine can easily
[T] use any video output device the xine library provides.
