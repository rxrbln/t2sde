[I] A non-linear DV editor for IEEE1394-DV

[T] Kino is a non-linear DV editor for GNU/Linux. It features excellent
[T] integration with IEEE-1394 for capture, VTR control, and recording back
[T] to the camera. It captures video to disk in RawDV and AVI format, in
[T] both type-1 DV and type-2 DV (separate audio stream) encodings.
[T] 
[T] You can load multiple video clips, cut and paste portions of
[T] video/audio, and save it to an edit decision list (SMIL XML format).
[T] Most edit and navigation commands are mapped to equivalent vi key
[T] commands. Also, Kino can load movies and export the composite movie in
[T] a number of formats: DV over IEEE 1394, Raw DV, DV AVI, still frames,
[T] WAV, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and DivX. Still frame export uses
[T] Imlib1, which has built-in support for PPM, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, and
[T] whatever your ImageMagick installation supports. MP3 requires lame. Ogg
[T] Vorbis requires oggenc. MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and DivX require mjpegtools
[T] 1.6.0.
