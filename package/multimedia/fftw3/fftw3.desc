[I] Fastest Fourier Transform in The West

[T] FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the
[T] Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in one or more
[T] dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of
[T] arbitrary input size. We believe that FFTW, which is
[T] free software, should become the FFT library of c
[T] choice for most applications. Our benchmarks, performed
[T] on on a variety of platforms, show that FFTW's
[T] performance is typically superior to that of other publicly
[T] available FFT software. Moreover, FFTW's performance
[T] is portable: the program will perform well on
[T] most architectures without modification.
[T]
[T] It is difficult to summarize in a few words all the
[T] complexities that arise when testing many programs, and
[T] there is no "best" or "fastest" program. However,
[T] FFTW appears to be the fastest program most of the
[T] time for in-order transforms, especially in the
[T] multi-dimensional and real-complex cases (Kasparov is
[T] the best chess player in the world even though he
[T] loses some games). Hence the name, "FFTW," which
[T] stands for the somewhat whimsical title of "Fastest
[T] Fourier Transform in the West." Please visit the
[T] benchFFT home page for a more extensive survey of
[T] the results. It comes with a MPI version and Matlab
[T] wrappers.
