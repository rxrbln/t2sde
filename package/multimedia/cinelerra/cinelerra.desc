[I] Movie studio for a Linux Box

[T] Cinelerra does primarily 3 main things: capturing, compositing, and editing
[T] audio and video with sample level accuracy. It's a seemless integration of
[T] audio, video, and still photos rarely experienced on a web server.
[T] If you want to make movies, you just want to defy the establishment, you
[T] want the same kind of compositing and editing suite that the big boys use,
[T] on the world's most efficient UNIX operating system, it's time for Cinelerra.
