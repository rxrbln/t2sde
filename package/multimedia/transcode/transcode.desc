[I] A video-stream processing tools

[T] transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool. It supports
[T] elementary video and audio frame transformations. Some example modules
[T] are included to enable import of MPEG-1/2, Digital Video, and other
[T] formats. It also includes export modules for writing to AVI files with
[T] DivX, OpenDivX, XviD, Digital Video or other codecs. Direct DVD
[T] transcoding is also supported. A set of tools is available to extract
