[I] DVB stream analyzer

[T] dvbsnoop is a DVB / MPEG stream analyzer program, which enables you to
[T] watch (live) stream information in human readable form.
[T] Its purpose is to debug, dump or view digital stream information (e.g.
[T] digital television broadcasts) send via satellite, cable or terrestrial.
[T] Streams can be SI, PES or TS. Basically you can describe dvbsnoop as a
[T] "swiss army knife" analyzing program for DVB, MHP, DSM-CC or MPEG - similar
[T] to TCP network sniffer programs like the old and famous snoop on Sun Solaris
[T] or tcpdump on Linux (which is in fact a kind of a snoop clone). You may also
[T] analyze offline mpeg streams, e.g. stored on DVD or mpeg2 movie files.
