[I] Library for capturing video (dv or mpeg2) over the IEEE 1394 bus

[T] The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
[T] MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
[T] transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
[T] transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
[T] represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for these
[T] media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
[T] modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
[T] control registers and connection management that previously existed in
[T] experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.
