[T] The MJPEG-tools are a basic set of utilities for recording, editing,
[T] playing back and encoding (to mpeg) video under linux. Recording can
[T] be done with zoran-based MJPEG-boards (LML33, Iomega Buz, Pinnacle
[T] DC10(+), Marvel G200/G400), these can also playback video using the
[T] hardware. With the rest of the tools, this video can be edited and
[T] encoded into mpeg1/2 or divx video.
