[I] A tool that streams DVB/MPEG2 over UDP

[T] DVBStreamer is a console application for streaming an entire DVB service
[T] over UDP. It differs from other DVB streaming applications by the use of
[T] the DVB-SI to work out the PIDs to stream and correctly streams services
[T] that use a separate PCR PID.
