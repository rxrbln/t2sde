[I] A powerful TV application

[T] MythTV is a suite of programs that allow you to build the mythical home
[T] media convergence box on your own using Open Source software and
[T] operating systems.
[T]
[T] Features include: You may pause, fast-forward and rewind live Television.
[T] You may install multiple video capture cards to record more than one
[T] program at a time.
[T] 
[T] You can have multiple servers, each with multiple capture cards in them.
[T] All servers are centrally managed and all programs are scheduled by the
[T] Master backend.
[T] 
[T] You can have multiple clients (called "frontends" in MythTV parlance),
[T] each with a common view of all available programs. Any client can watch
[T] any program that was recorded by any of the servers. Clients can be
[T] diskless and controlled entirely by a remote control.
[T] 
[T] You may use any combination of standard analog capture card, MPEG-2,
[T] MJPEG, DVB or HDTV capture devices. With appropriate hardware, MythTV can
[T] control set top boxes found in digital cable and satellite TV systems.
[T] 
[T] Program Guide Data in North America is downloaded from Zap2It.com. This
[T] free service provides MythTV almost two weeks of scheduling information.
[T] Program Guide Data in other countries is obtained using XMLTV. MythTV uses
[T] this information to create a schedule that maximizes the number of programs
[T] that can be recorded if you don't have enough tuners.
