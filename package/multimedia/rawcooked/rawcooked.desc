[I] Easily archive RAW audio-visual content into a lossless format

[T] RAWcooked easily encodes RAW audio-visual sequences into a lossless video
[T] stream with FFmpeg using a Matroska container (MKV), the FFV1 video code
[T] and the FLAC audio codec. The metadata accompanying the RAW data is fully
[T] preserved allowing to retrieve the RAW source in its original form with
[T] bit-by-bit accuracy allowing faster access to original material than
[T] retrieving the same file from LTO tape storage.
