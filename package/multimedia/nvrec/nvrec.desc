[I] High performance audio/video capture engine

[T] This is an attempt at a high performance audio/video capture engine.  It
[T] currently only supports v4l1, v4l2 and OSS drivers. This engine makes
[T] use of deep buffers (2 seconds+) for audio and video.  The video is
[T] buffered in the driver to avoid too many costly userspace copies.  The
[T] audio is buffered in a userspace ring buffer.  This is expensive, but
[T] neccessary, as OSS drivers are often limited to very short buffers.
