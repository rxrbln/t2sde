[I] A standalone Linux digital VCR/PVR

[T] Freevo is a Linux application that turns a PC with a TV
[T] capture card and/or TV-out into a standalone multimedia
[T] jukebox/VCR/PVR/HTPC/DVR/set-top box. It uses MPlayer and other
[T] applications to play and record audio and video. It is optimized for
[T] use with a TV and remote, but can be used with a monitor and keyboard.
