[I] A KDE DVB applicattion

[T] KaxTV is a software DVB player. It uses Xine as software decoder, but
[T] does NOT make use of the xine dvb plugin. KaxTV is based on Kaffeine,
[T] so you should be able to play nearly every audio/video file, including
[T] dvd.
[T] It allows Channels management, including network scan, Time shifting,
[T] Instant recording, Timers, Current/next OSD, EPG, Pids filtering, so you
[T] can view a channel while recording another on the same transponder (or
[T] record several), AC3 and HDTV (with cpu/videocard able to play such
[T] bitrates/sizes)
