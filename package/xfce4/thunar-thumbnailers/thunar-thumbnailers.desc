[I] A plugin for the new modern file manager for Xfce

[T] Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment.
[T] Thunar uses external utilities - so called thumbnailers - to generate
[T] previews of certain files. Thunar ships with thumbnailers to generate
[T] previews of image and font files and can automatically use available
[T] GNOME thumbnailers if it was build with support for gconf.
