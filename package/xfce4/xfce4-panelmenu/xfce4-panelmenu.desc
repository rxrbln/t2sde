[I] Menu plugin for the XFce4 panel

[T] Xfce4 Panel Menu is a plugin for the Xfce4 panel that provides a menu
[T] similar to the start menu in Windows XP. It contains an applications
[T] menu, a menu of recently opened apps, and user-defined shortcuts. It
[T] also includes a device mounter, from which it possible to mount devices
[T] listed in the fstab configuration file. The application menu and user
[T] shortcuts are stored in the same format as the Xfce4 root menu, so
[T] they can be edited with the tool that cames with the Xfce environment.
