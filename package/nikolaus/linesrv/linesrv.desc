[I] LineServer deamon

[T] This is LineControl Server. It is designed to run on a Linux masquerading 
[T] server which has for example a dial-up line to your ISP to control.
[T] LC is something similar to masqdialer and other remote control programs for 
[T] network-connections. 
[T] With LineControl you can use the old scripts you used to control your 
[T] connection manually. So it's very easy to switch from telnet to LineControl.
[T] LineControl needs a client application on each host using the dial-up line. 
[T] It takes care about the number of clients using the line and decides upon this 
[T] value whether the masquerading server should be connected to the internet or not.
