[I] An OpenGL image viewer

[T] GLiv is an OpenGL image viewer. Image loading is done via Gdk-pixbuf
[T] bundled with GTK+-2. 6, rendering with OpenGL, and the graphical
[T] user interface uses GTK+ with GtkGLExt. GLiv is very fast and smooth
[T] at rotating, panning, and zooming if you have an OpenGL accelerated
[T] graphics board. It supports thumbnails and navigating through them using
[T] two images menus.
