[I] A fast, modern and generic image processing library

[T] ExactImage is a fast C++ image processing library. Unlike many other
[T] library frameworks it allows operation in several color spaces and bit
[T] depths natively, resulting in much lower memory and computational
[T] requirements.
[T]
[T] ExactImage comes with standard algorithms, such as rotation, scaling,
[T] generic convolutions, etc. as well as state of the art de-skew and
[T] auto-crop, pattern recognition as well as barcode recognition.
[T]
[T] Specialized support for handling JPEG and JPEG2000 data is available,
[T] including optimized and loss-less orthogonal rotation, as well as
[T] fast downscaling for JPEG, embedding JPEG images in EPS and PS, and
[T] embedding JPEG and JPEG2000 images in PDF.
[T]
[T] Rendering vector data from SVG or programatically is supported via
[T] the high-quality Anti-Grain-Geometry library.
[T]
[T] A bridge to several scripting languages is provided via SWIG, and
[T] available for Perl, PHP, Python and Lua by default.
