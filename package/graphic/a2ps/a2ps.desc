[I] Converts text and other types of files to PostScript(TM)

[T] GNU a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter.  Of course it processes plain
[T] text files, but also pretty prints quite a few popular languages.
[T]
[T] Its slogan is precisely ` Do The Right Thing '', which means that
[T] though it is highly configurable, everything was made so that a novice
[T] user can do complicated PostScript manipulations.  For instance, it
[T] has the ability to delegate the processing of some files to other
[T] filters (such as groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip etc.), what allows a
[T] uniform treatment (n-up, page selection, duplex etc.) of heterogeneous
[T] files.
