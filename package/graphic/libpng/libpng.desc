[I] Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Reference Library

[T] PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for the
[T] lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides
[T] a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many
[T] common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are
[T] supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range from
[T] 1 to 16 bits.
