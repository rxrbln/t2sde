[I] A tool that uses a model of human vision to diff images

[T] Perceptual Image Diff is a command line utility that tells you if two
[T] similar images are different from the point of view of a theoretical
[T] human observer. It's useful for running automated regression testing on
[T] images that are perceptually identical but have minor pixel noise from
[T] different random number generators or small changes to algorithms.
