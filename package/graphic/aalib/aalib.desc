[I] A low level gfx library that works on any kind of terminal

[T] AA-lib is a low level gfx library just as many other libraries are.
[T] The main difference is that AA-lib does not require graphics device.
[T] In fact, there is no graphical output possible. AA-lib replaces those
[T] old-fashioned output methods with powerful ascii-art renderer. Now my
[T] linux boots with a nice penguin logo at secondary display (yes! Like
[T] Win95 does:) AA-lib API is designed to be similar to other graphics
[T] libraries. Learning a new API would be a piece of cake!
