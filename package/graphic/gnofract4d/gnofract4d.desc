[I] Anopen source fractal image generator with animation capabilities

[T] Gnofract4D is an free, open source program, which allows anyone to create
[T] beautiful images called fractals. The images are automatically created by
[T] the computer, based on mathematical principles. These include Mandelbrot and
[T] Julia sets and many more. It includes a formula compiler, which allows you
[T] to use any function you can think of, besides supporting Fracting and
[T] UltraFractal formulas and coloring algorithms.
