[I] A set of utilities to process high dynamic range images

[T] PFSTools is a set of command line (and one GUI) programs for reading,
[T] writing, manipulating and viewing high dynamic range (HDR) images and video
[T] frames. All programs in the package, exchange data using a simple generic
[T] file format (pfs) for HDR data. The concept of PFSTools is similar to netpbm
[T] package, for low dynamic range images. PFSTools comes with a library for
[T] reading and writing pfs files. The library can be used for writing custom
[T] applications that can integrate with the existing pfstools programs.
[T] PFSTools also offers a good integration with high level programming language
[T] GNU Octave, and can e used as an extension of Octave, for reading and
[T] writing HDR images, or simply to store effectively large matrices.
[T] Note that pfs is not just another format for storing HDR images (and there
[T] are already quite a few of them). It is more an attempt to integrate the
[T] existing file formats, by providing a simple data format, that can be used
[T] to exchange data between applications.
