[I] A drop-down console window for SDL programs

[T] This is a console that can be added to any SDL application. It is
[T] similar to Quake and other game consoles but with lots of added
[T] features. A console is meant to be a very simple way of interacting
[T] with a program and executing commands. Commands are linked to the
[T] console with callback functions so that when a command is typed in,
[T] a specific function is executed automatically.
