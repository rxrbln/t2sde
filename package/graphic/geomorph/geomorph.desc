[I] An height field generator and editor for Linux

[T] Geomorph is an height field generator and editor for Linux. An heightmap is
[T] a kind of topographic map, a 2d projection of a 3d landscape.
[T] Geomorph generates square images and shows a 3d preview of the resulting
[T] landscape. The resulting 2d image can be processed with a tool like, Povray
[T] for instance, for rendering the landscape.
[T] It's main features are, for now, an environment allowing multiple documents
[T] in multiple windows, output in PNG format with 16bpc, from 128x128 to 4k res
[T] work, a fractal pen for drawing irregular surfaces, pens for drawing smooth
[T] strokes, craters, faults, cracks and fissures, as well as image editing and
[T] transform tools. Tools for erosion, quantization ("terraces"), cityscapes,
[T] etc. an opengl preview, and povray preview.
