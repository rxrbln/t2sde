[I] A GIMP plugin for texture synthesis

[T] Resynthesizer is a GIMP plugin for texture synthesis. Given a sample of a
[T] texture, it can create more of that texture. This has a surprising number of
[T] uses: Creating more of a texture (including creation of tileable textures),
[T] removing objects from images (great for touching up photos), creating themed
[T] images.
