[I] 2-D rasterization library

[T] Libxmi is a standalone C library for rasterizing 2-D vector graphics
[T] primitives such as wide polygonal lines, circular and elliptic arcs,
[T] and filled polygons. It's based on the vector graphics code in most
[T] X Window System servers. Some rendering extensions have been added,
[T] such as support for multicolored dashing patterns. Despite its origins,
[T] libxmi is completely decoupled from X11. It draws vector graphics onto
[T] a user-supplied matrix of pixels, not onto an on-screen window. It uses
[T] its own two-stage graphics pipeline.
