[I] Data display engine

[T] Ploticus is free software that generates plots and graphs from data.
[T] The primary components are the ploticus program and libploticus C
[T] language API. Create basic plots quickly from the command line using
[T] prefabs, or write customized scripts for maximum power and flexibility.
[T] You can invoke it manually, automatically from other programs, or
[T] directly as a CGI. Produce PNG, GIF, JPEG, SVG or SWF (flash),
[T] PostScript/EPS, or X11 graphics. Clickmaps and mouseover popup labels
[T] are supported for interactive web use.
