[I] The GNU Triangulated Surface Library

[T] GTS stands for the GNU Triangulated Surface Library. It is an Open Source
[T] Free Software Library intended to provide a set of useful functions to deal
[T] with 3D surfaces meshed with interconnected triangles. The goal of GTS is
[T] to provide a simple and efficient library to scientists dealing with 3D
[T] computational surface meshes. Its features include a simple object-oriented
[T] structure, giving acess to topological properties. 2D dynamic Delaunay and
[T] constrained Delaunay triangulations, robsut geometric predicates using fast
[T] adaptative floating point arithmetic, boolean operations on surfaces,
[T] surface refinement and coarsening, amongst others.
