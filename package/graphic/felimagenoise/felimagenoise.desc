[I] An advanced noise generation GIMP plugin

[T] FelimageNoise is a GIMP plugin, originally developed, to generate noise
[T] patterns, but with feature sizes larger than a single pixel. It can generate
[T] tileable textures, textures for use in spherical mapping. It can use
[T] foreground/background colors, gradients and independent RGBA channels or
[T] warp an image. It implemens several noise functions, such as FBM (Fractal
[T] Brownian Motion) and Multifractal textures, with complete control, to allow
[T] for animation of noise (useful to generate animation frames), as well as
[T] complete presets management.
