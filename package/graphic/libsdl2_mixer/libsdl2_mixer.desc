[I] Simple Directmedia Layer - Mixer

[T] SDL_mixer is a sound mixing library that is used with the SDL2 library,
[T] and almost as portable. It allows a programmer to use multiple samples
[T] along with music without having to code a mixing algorithm themselves.
[T] It also simplyfies the handling of loading and playing samples and
[T] music from all sorts of file formats.
