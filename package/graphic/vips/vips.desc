[I] VIPS is an image processing suite designed for large images and colorimetry

[T] VIPS is a free image processing system. It aims to be half-way between
[T] Photoshop and Excel: it is very bad at retouching photographcs, but very
[T] handy for the many other imaging tasks that programs like Photoshop get
[T] used for. It is good with large images (images larger than the amount of
[T] RAM in your machine), and for working with color. It comes in two main
[T] parts. Libvips is the image processing library, and nip2 is the graphical
[T] user interface.
