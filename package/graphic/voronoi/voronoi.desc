[I] A pattern generation GIMP plugin

[T] Imagine a finite set of points in some metric space (or just normal
[T] n-dimensional space, if you don't know much about metric spaces). If you now
[T] take any point of the space, there definitively exists a point of the set
[T] which is closest to this point. This way the set breaks the space into parts
[T] called cells, each consisting of points nearest to a one point of the set.
[T] This division is what is called Voronoi diagram of the set.
[T] Voronoi, is a GIMP plugin that generates 2D Voronoi diagrams of the various
[T] semi-random sets of points, and them visualizes them.
