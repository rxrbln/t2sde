[I] Open source parametrical modelling of 3d humanoid characters

[T] MakeHuman is an OpenSource, open graphics library, standalone, multiplatform
[T] program, written in C++. It's purpose is to provide a versatile application
[T] for parametrical modelling of three-dimensional humanoid characters.
[T] That means that MakeHuman's purpose is to model and pose a 3d humanoid,
[T] complete with hair, accessories and high quality UV maps. By parametrical
[T] this means that MakeHuman has the ability to model a 3d humanoid in realtime
[T] using a series of graphically represented parameters. By using these
[T] parameters, nearly any type of character imaginable will be able to be
[T] created; scientific (typological and anthropological classifications),
[T] morphologic (gender, height, weight, age and race), or artistic (fantasy
[T] characters or caricatures). The parameters will allow the modification of
[T] nearly any humanoid characteristic - from general features such as body
[T] weight, to the specific details of a nose.
[T] Any humanoid character will be able to be directly exported to many 3D
[T] graphics modelling programs in their format, such as .obj or .3ds.
[T] Photorealistic images of characters, with a transparent background, will be
[T] able to be produced via RenderMan compliant rendering applications, such as
[T] Pixie, and Aqsis.
