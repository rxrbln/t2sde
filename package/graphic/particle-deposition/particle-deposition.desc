[I] A GIMP plugin that simulates particle deposition on surfaces

[T] Particle Deposition is a GIMP plugin, that simulates particle deposition on
[T] a surface, using the Monte Carlo method. In other words, it generates small
[T] particles, with random size and velocity (including direction), and lets 
[T] them fall onto the surface, where they settle, increasing surface height
[T] locally. The resulting heightfield is then visualized. The surface is taken
[T] to be periodid, so the resulting texture is always perfectly tileable.
