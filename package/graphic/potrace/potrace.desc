[I] Transforms bitmaps into vector graphics
[T] potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap (that is, transforming
[T] a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image). The input is a portable
[T] bitmap (PBM), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript
[T] file (EPS). A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data,
[T] such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The
[T] resulting image is not &amp;quot;jaggy&amp;quot; like a bitmap,
[T] but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.
