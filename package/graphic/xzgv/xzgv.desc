[I] Gtk+ image viewer

[T] xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector.
[T] It uses GTK+ and Imlib. Most file formats are supported, and the
[T] thumbnails used are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. It can also
[T] be used with `xzgv file(s)', to effectively bypass the file selector.
[T] For more on how xzgv works and how to use it, do `info xzgv' or `man
[T] xzgv' once it's installed.
[T]
[T] xzgv differs from other picture viewers for X in that it uses one
[T] window for both the file selector and viewer, it (unlike xv) allows
[T] both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of viewing large pictures,
[T] and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's
[T] aspect ratio without you telling it to.
[T]
[T] It also provides extensive keyboard support; if you prefer using the
[T] keyboard, this is almost certainly the best viewer for you. But it
[T] doesn't skimp on the mousey stuff, either.
[T]
[T] So anyway, it's just terribly great. :-)
