[I] A C++ class-based wrapper for SDL

[T] SDLmm is a C++ glue for SDL, or the Simple DirectMedia Layer, which
[T] is a generic API that provides low level access to audio, keyboard,
[T] mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D framebuffer across
[T] multiple platforms.
[T]
[T] SDLmm aims to stay as close as possible to the C API while taking
[T] advantage of native C++ features like object orientation. We will
[T] also aim at being platform independent as much as possible. I.e we'll
[T] try to support ever platform supported by SDL.
