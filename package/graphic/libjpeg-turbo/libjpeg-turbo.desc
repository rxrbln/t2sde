[I] The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software with SIMD enhancements

[T] libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg which uses SIMD instructions
[T] (MMX, SSE2, etc.) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and
[T] decompression on x86 and x86-64 systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo
[T] is generally 2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all
[T] else being equal.
