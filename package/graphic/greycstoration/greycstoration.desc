[I] GREYCstoration Gimp plugin

[T] GREYCstoration is an image regularization algorithm which processes an
[T] image by locally removing small variations of pixel intensities while
[T] preserving significant global image features, such as sharp edges and
[T] corners. The most direct application of image regularization is denoising.
[T] By extension, it can also be used to inpaint or resize images.
