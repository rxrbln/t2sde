[I] A utility for converting and manipulating raw images from digital cameras

[T] UFRaw is a utility for converting and manipulating raw images from
[T] digital cameras. It can be used as a stand-alone tool or as
[T] a Gimp plugin, and images can be batch processed using the
[T] commandline interface. UFRaw reads most existing raw formats
[T] using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility DCRaw, and it supports
[T] basic color management using Little CMS, allowing the user to
[T] apply color profiles. For Nikon users, UFRaw has the advantage
[T] that it can read the camera's tone curves. Even if you don't
[T] own a Nikon, you can still apply a Nikon curve to your images.
