[I] An SDL2 compatibility layer that uses SDL3 behind the scenes

[T] This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a general API that provides low level
[T] access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D
[T] framebuffer across multiple platforms. This code is a compatibility layer;
[T] it provides a binary and source compatible API for programs written against
[T] SDL2, but it uses SDL3 behind the scenes. If you are writing new code,
[T] please target SDL3 directly and do not use this layer.
