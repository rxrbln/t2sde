[I] A stroke (pushes) interface library

[T] LibStroke is a stroke interface library.  Strokes are motions
[T] of the mouse that can be interpreted by a program as a command.  Strokes
[T] are used extensively in CAD programs.  I fell in love with them when I was
[T] using the Mentor Graphics CAD tools and the CAD tools internally developed
[T] by Intel.  I am writing this library so that others can see how useful
[T] strokes can be and so that more programs take advantage of this extremely
[T] natural human-computer interface.
