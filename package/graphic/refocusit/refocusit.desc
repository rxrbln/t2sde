[I] Refocusing plugin for GIMP

[T] The Refocus-it GIMP plugin, can be used to refocus images acquired by a
[T] defocused camera, blurred by gaussian or motion blur, or any combination
[T] of these. Some of the features of this plugin include adaptative/static
[T] area smoothing, used to remove the so called "ringing" effect, introduced
[T] by edges in the image, and effects introduced by noise. Mirror and
[T] periodical boundary conditions are available. The algorithm is based on
[T] finding the minimum of the error function using Hopfield neural network.
