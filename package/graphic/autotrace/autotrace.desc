[I] Converts bitmap to vector graphics

[T] AutoTrace is a program for converting bitmaps to vector graphics.
[T] The aim of the AutoTrace project is the development of a freely-available

[T] is already better. Originally being created as a plugin for the GIMP,
[T] AutoTrace is now a standalone program and can be compiled on any UNIX
[T] platform using GCC.
