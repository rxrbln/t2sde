[I] Nip2 is a GTK frontend for VIPS, an image processing library/suite

[T] Nip2 aims to be halfway between Excel and Photoshop. You don't directly
[T] edit images, instead, like a spreadsheet, you build relationships between
[T] objects. When you make a change somewhere, nip2 will recalculate the
[T] objects affected by that change. Since it is demand-driven, this update is
[T] usually (almost) instant, even for very very large images.
