[I] A computer vision library

[T] VIGRA stands for "Vision with Generic Algorithms". It's a novel computer
[T] vision library, that puts its main emphasize on customizable algorithms and
[T] data structures. By using template techniques similar to those in the C++
[T] Standard Template Library, you can easily adapt any VIGRA component to the
[T] needs of your application, without thereby giving up execution speed.
