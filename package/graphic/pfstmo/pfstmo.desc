[I] A set of tone mapping operators for image processing

[T] Pfstmo contains an implementation of state of the art tone mapping
[T] operators. The motivation here is to provide an implementation of tone
[T] mapping operators suitable for convenient processing of both static images
[T] and animations. The operators are embebbed in a flexible framework
[T] (pfstools) with provide an unified input/output mechanism and a modular
[T] architecture for the filtering of image data. Various file formats for
[T] static images and video are transparently supported, and the High Dynamic
[T] Range data is processed modularly through a piping mechanism. Implemented
[T] are the following tone mapping operators: Ashikhmin, Drago, Durand, Fattal,
[T] Pattanaik, and Reinhard operators.
