[I] A library to decode popular audio formats

[T] SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular
[T] sound file formats, such as .WAV and .MP3. It is meant to make the
[T] programmer's sound playback tasks simpler. The programmer gives
[T] SDL_sound a filename, or feeds it data directly from one of many
[T] sources, and then reads the decoded waveform data back at her leisure.
[T] If resource constraints are a concern, SDL_sound can process sound
[T] data in programmer-specified blocks. Alternately, SDL_sound can decode
[T] a whole sound file and hand back a single pointer to the whole
[T] waveform. SDL_sound can also handle sample rate, audio format, and
[T] channel conversion on-the-fly and behind-the-scenes, if the programmer
[T] desires.
