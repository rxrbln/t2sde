[I] An SDL-1.2 compatibility layer that uses SDL 2.0 behind the scenes

[T] This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a general API that provides low level
[T] access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D
[T] framebuffer across multiple platforms. This code is a compatibility layer; it
[T] provides a binary and source compatible API for programs written against SDL
[T] 1.2, but it uses SDL 2.0 behind the scenes. If you are writing new code, please
[T] target SDL 2.0 directly and do not use this layer.
