[I] A program for making large letters out of ordinary text

[T] FIGlet prints its input  using  large  characters  (called
[T] ``FIGcharacters'')made  up  of  ordinary screen characters
[T] (called ``sub-characters'').  FIGlet output  is  generally
[T] reminiscent of the sort of ``signatures'' many people like
[T] to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet  messages.   It  is
[T] also  reminiscent  of  the output of some banner programs,
[T] although it is oriented normally, not sideways.
