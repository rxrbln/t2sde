[I] A program to create labels for cdroms

[T] cdlabelgen is a Perl script that generates printouts suitable for use
[T] as CD jewel case inserts or CD envelopes. Both normal sized cases and
[T] slim cases are handled. cdlabelgen can be used to create table of
[T] contents for music CDs, archival CDs, etc., with customizable logos
[T] or background images, and it generates PostScript files as output.
[T] The package also includes a Perl CGI Web script which accepts JPEG
[T] images as logos or backgrounds, and can also create PDF output files.
