[I] Script based vector graphics language

[T] Asymptote is a powerful script-based vector graphics language
[T] that provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical
[T] drawing. Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX, for
[T] high-quality PostScript output.
[T] A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is
[T] that it is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics
[T] program: it can therefore exploit the best features of script
[T] (command-driven) and graphical user interface (GUI) methods.
