[I]  Fyre is a tool for producing artwork based on iterated chaotic functions

[T]  Fyre is a tool for producing computational artwork based on histograms of
[T]  iterated chaotic functions. At the moment, it implements the Peter de Jong
[T]  map in a fixed-function pipeline with an interactive GTK+ frontend and a
[T]  command line interface for easy and efficient rendering of high-resolution
[T]  high quality images.
[T]  This software includes some image manipulation features that let you apply
[T]  linear interpolation and gamma correction at the full internal precision
[T]  producing a much higher quality image than if you tried to create the same
[T]  effects using standard image processing tools. Additionally, Gaussian
[T]  blurs can be applied to the image using a stochastic process that produces
[T]  much more natural-looking images than most programs, again, withou loosing
[T]  any of the image's original precision.
