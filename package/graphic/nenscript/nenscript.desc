[I] Converts text files to PostScript

[T] Converts text files to PostScript format for printing. Basically a
[T] lighter version of enscript, which allows you to send plain text in a nice
[T] format (Courier font only) to a PostScript printer. It has many command
[T] line options, including dual columns, landscape mode and gaudy mode.
