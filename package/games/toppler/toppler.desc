[I] A jump and run game

[T] In this game you have to help a cute little green animal switch off
[T] some kind of "evil" mechanism. The "power off switch" is hidden
[T] somewhere in high towers. On your way to the target you need to avoid
[T] a lot of strange robots that guard the tower.
[T]
[T] That sounds all like a normal jump and run game. What makes this game
[T] different is that you walk around the tower which is revolving on the
[T] screen, so that you only see the 180° that are currently visible.
[T]
[T] The game is a reimplementation of the old game known as Tower Toppler
[T] or Nebulus. It was available for PC, Atari, C64. The author was
[T] J.M.Phillips and was published by Hewson software. I have seen the PC
[T] version on quite a few abandonware sites. But it is only a DOS version
[T] and uses ugly graphics.
