[I] A Backgammon implementation - to lay and analys games and matches

[T] It is currently a work-in-progress. So far it is able to play both
[T] independent games and tournament matches, evaluate and roll out
[T] positions, tune its own evaluation functions using either TD or
[T] supervised training, maintain databases of positions for training
[T] and other purposes, and more.
[T]
[T] It is driven by a command-line interface, and displays an ASCII
[T] rendition of a board on text-only terminals, but also allows the
[T] user to play games and manipulate positions with a GTK+ board window
[T] where available. It is extensible on platforms which support Guile.
[T]
[T] It currently plays at about the level of a championship flight
[T] tournament player (depending on its parameters and its luck in recent
[T] games, it rates at around 2000 on FIBS, the First Internet Backgammon
[T] Server -- at its best, it is in the top 5 of over 6000 rated players
[T] there) and is gradually improving; it should be somewhat stronger than
[T] this when released. Since almost all of the CPU time required during
[T] supervised training is spent performing rollouts, and rollouts can
[T] easily be performed in parallel, it is hoped that users will be able
[T] to pool rollout results and collectively train it to a level stronger
[T] than any individual could obtain.
