[I] Library for quickly assembling 3d simulations, games, and visualization applications

[T] SimGear is a set of open-source libraries designed to be used as 
[T] building blocks for quickly assembling 3d simulations, games, and 
[T] visualization applications.
[T] 
[T] SimGear is a relatively new project, and while quite a bit of code 
[T] has been written in conjunction with the FlightGear project, the 
[T] final interface and arrangements are still evolving.
