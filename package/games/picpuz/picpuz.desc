[I] Picpuz is a free Linux "jigsaw puzzle" program

[T] You can take almost any image (jpeg, tiff, png ...) and scramble it into
[T] many pieces (tens to hundreds). You can then reassemble the picture using
[T] the mouse to move the pieces around.
[T] Note, version 2.4 is the last to use gtk2. Not hosted by author anymore.
