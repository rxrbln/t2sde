[I] Oxyd free puzzle game clone

[T] Enigma is a tribute to and a re-implementation of one of the most
[T] original and intriguing computer games of the 1990's: Oxyd.  Your
[T] objective is easily explained: find and uncover all pairs of identical
[T] Oxyd stones in each landscape.  Sounds simple?  It would be, if it
[T] weren't for hidden traps, vast mazes, insurmountable obstacles and
[T] innumerable puzzles blocking your direct way to the Oxyd stones...
