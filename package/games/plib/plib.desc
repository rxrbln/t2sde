[I] A Suite of Portable Game Libraries

[T] The author (and an ever increasing band of helpers) has been spending 
[T] time to build a set of OpenSource (LGPL) libraries that will permit 
[T] programmers to write games and other realtime interactive applications 
[T] that are 100% portable across a wide range of hardware and operating 
[T] systems.
[T]
[T] PLIB includes sound effects, music, a complete 3D engine, font 
[T] rendering, a GUI, networking, 3D math library and a collection of handy 
[T] utility functions. All are 100% portable across nearly all modern 
[T] computing platforms. What's more, it's all available on line - and 
[T] completely free.
