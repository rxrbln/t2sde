[I] A Panzer General clone

[T] LGeneral is a turn-based strategy engine heavily inspired by Panzer
[T] General. You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn
[T] against a human player or the AI. Entrenchment, rugged defense,
[T] defensive fire, surprise contacts, surrender, unit supply, weather
[T] influence, reinforcements and other implementations contribute to
[T] the tactical and strategic depth of the game.
