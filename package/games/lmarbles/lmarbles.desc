[I] An Atomix clone

[T] I always liked the game Atomix and wanted to write a clone for 
[T] Linux. But some guys had this idea before me so I slightly changed 
[T] the concept from assembling molecules to creating figures out of 
[T] single marbles. Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If 
[T] a marble starts to move it will not stop until it hits a wall or 
[T] marble. And to make it even more interesting there are obstacles 
[T] like one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals. As Marbles is 
[T] meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit and not a time 
[T] limit. This way you have as much time as you need to think.
