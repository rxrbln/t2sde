[I] An Atomix clone

[T] I always liked the game Atomix and wanted to write a clone for
[T] Linux. But some guys had this idea before me so I slightly changed
[T] the concept from assembling molecules to creating figures out of
[T] single marbles. Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If
[T] a marble starts to move it will not stop until it hits a wall or
[T] marble. And to make it even more interesting there are obstacles
[T] like one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals. As Marbles is
[T] meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit and not a time
[T] limit. This way you have as much time as you need to think.
