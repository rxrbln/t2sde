[I] Flight Gear is a free flight simulator project

[T] The idea for Flight Gear was born out of a dissatisfaction with current
[T] commercial PC flight simulators. A big problem with these simulators is
[T] their proprietariness and lack of extensibility. There are so many
[T] people across the world with great ideas for enhancing the currently
[T] available simulators who have the ability to write code, and who have a
[T] desire to learn and contribute. Many people involved in education and
[T] research could use a spiffy flight simulator frame work on which to
[T] build their own projects; however, commercial simulators do not lend
[T] themselves to modification and enhancement. The Flight Gear project is
[T] striving to fill these gaps.
[T]
[T] Flight Gear requires a supported 3d video accelerator.
