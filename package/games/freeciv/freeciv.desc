[I] A Civ II like multiplayer strategy game

[T] Freeciv is a multiuser reimplementation for Unix/X of the famous
[T] Microprose game of Civilization. By default, the game is an improved
[T] Civ II, but this can be customized; modpacks for near-100% compatibility
[T] with Civ I and Civ II are included. Multiuser gameplay is real-time:
[T] in each turn, all human players move concurrently. The game is designed
[T] to remain fairly playable even on poor network connections. Freeciv can
[T] also be played on standalone machines, and its AI players are a good
[T] challenge for beginners. The source code comes with the server, two
[T] X clients, and non-X clients for MS Windows and Amiga. Freeciv is
[T] released under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by an
[T] international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is easily one of the
[T] most fun and addictive network games out there.
