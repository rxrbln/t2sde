[I] A breakout like game in the style of Arkanoid clone

[T] The polished successor to LBreakout offers you a new challenge in 
[T] more than 50 levels with loads of new bonuses (goldshower, joker, 
[T] explosive balls, bonus magnet ...), maluses (chaos, darkness, weak 
[T] balls, malus magnet ...) and special bricks (growing bricks, 
[T] explosive bricks, regenerative bricks, indestructible bricks, 
[T] chaotic bricks).
[T] And if you're through with all the levels you can create complete 
[T] new levelsets with the integrated easy-to-use level editor!
