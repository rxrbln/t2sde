[I] A Memory-like strategy game

[T] LPairs is the classical memory game. This means you have to find 
[T] pairs of identical cards which will then be removed. Your time and 
[T] tries needed will be counted but there is no highscore chart or 
[T] limit to this. I wrote this game to improve my memory a bit as I 
[T] have some problems in remembering things.
