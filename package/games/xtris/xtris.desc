[I] A multiplayer version of the classical game of Tetris

[T] Xtris is a true client/server game (as opposed to a centralized game
[T] managing multiple display) which makes it particularily responsive and
[T] bandwidth effective. It can handle human players and automated ones
[T] (bots), and includes a simple chat system.
