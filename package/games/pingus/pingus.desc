[I] a free Lemmings[tm] clone

[T] The player takes command in the game of a bunch of small animals 
[T] and has to guide them around in levels. Since the animals walk on 
[T] their own, the player can only influence them by giving them commands, 
[T] like build a bridge, dig a hole or redirect all animals in the other 
[T] direction. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for fix 
[T] multiple combination of commands are necesarry. The game is presented 
[T] in a 2D site view. 
[T] 
[T] While Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings[tm], it has included 
[T] some other ideas, which weren't presented in the original Lemmings[tm], 
[T] like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar from games 
[T] the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. We have also a few new 
[T] actions, like the jumper which weren't presented in the original game.
