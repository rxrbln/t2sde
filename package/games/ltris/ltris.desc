[I] A Tetris clone

[T] LTris is a very polished Tetris clone and highly configurable due
[T] to it's menu. It offers you the well-known gametype Classic, a
[T] funny gametype Figures (new figure each level, suddenly appearing
[T] tiles and lines) and Multiplayer with up to three players either
[T] controlled by human or CPU.
[T] In fact, even if you don't like Tetris you should download this
[T] just to see your CPU in action in mode Demo
