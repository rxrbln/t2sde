[I] A tactical board game

[T] In Squaroid the object of the game is to score 150 points and to 
[T] defeat your opponent by a margin of at least 15 points.
[T] 
[T] You can earn points by making squares -- that is, you put your stones 
[T] down on the board so that you've got one stone at each corner of a 
[T] square. The value of a square is determined by its size, from the 
[T] minimum of 4 points up to the maximum of 64. If you've got three 
[T] corners of a square, and your opponent grabs the last corner before 
[T] you can take it, nobody gets the points for that square.
