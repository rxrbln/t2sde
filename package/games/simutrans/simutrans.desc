[I] An Economy and Transport Simulation Game

[T] Simutrans is a transport and economic simulation game. Simutrans has 
[T] not yet reached production state, but it is quite possible to build 
[T] big transport networks between the industries and cities.
[T] 
[T] The player can create bus and rail connections and transport 
[T] passengers, mail and goods in and between cities and industries. Even 
[T] passenger ferries and oil tankers are included in the game. Goods are 
[T] produced by industries from raw materials, sometimes over many steps 
[T] of intermediate products. I.e. coal and iron ore are needed to produce 
[T] steel in a steel mill. Oil may be transformed to plastics in a 
[T] refinery. Plastics and steel are used to build cars by the car 
[T] industry. Finally the cars are sold in the cities. Now they need gas 
[T] to run, which also will be produced at the refinery.
[T] 
[T] All goods need to be transported. This is the players task. Transport 
[T] the goods and let the industry live up. But be careful not to destroy 
[T] your environments.
