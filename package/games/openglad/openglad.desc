[I] A Linux Port of Gladiator

[T] Openglad is an SDL port of an old DOS game called Gladiator, which
[T] was developed by FSGames in the mid 90's. FSGames donated the original
[T] source (made for DOS, of course) under the GPL when one of them found
[T] our earlier project (now abandoned in favor of this one) to make a
[T] full Gladiator clone.
[T]
[T] Gladiator is a top-down gauntlet-style RPG. In it, you hire team mates,
[T] go on missions, and improve your team with the spoils you reap. It can
[T] be played by up to 4 players (using split-screen), and comes with a
[T] scenario editor.
