[I] A tactical war game in the tradition of Battle Isle

[T] The outcome of the war lies in your hands. You decide which units
[T] are sent to the front lines, and when to unleash the reserves. Your
[T] mission objectives range from defending strategically vital locations
[T] to simply destroying all enemy forces in the area. Protect supply
[T] convoys or raid enemy facilities to uncover technological secrets or
[T] fill your storage bays so you can repair damaged units or build new
[T] ones in your own factories. Lead your troops to victory!
[T]
[T] Tools are available to create custom maps and campaigns. You can also
[T] play the original Battle Isle maps if you have a copy of the game.
[T]
[T] You can pit yourself against another human player either in hot-seat
[T] mode in front of the same machine or via e- mail, or against the
[T] computer.
