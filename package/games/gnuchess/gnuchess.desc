[I] GNU chess

[T] GNU Chess lets most modern computers play a full game of chess. It 
[T] has a plain terminal interface but supports visual interfaces such 
[T] as X-Windows "xboard".
[T]
[T] Version 5.06 is the current release. Version 5 shares no code with 
[T] versions 1.x through 4.x. This release features simplified chess code 
[T] and modern data structures, which make it more pedantically accessible, 
[T] easier to modify, and more understandable for skilled chess experts 
[T] who are not necessarily programmers.
[T] 
[T] Chua Kong-Sian is the primary author of GNU Chess 5's precursor 
[T] program (Cobalt, which maintains a separate but cooperative parallel 
[T] development path.) Several features have been integrated or written 
[T] by Stuart Cracraft (opening book code, documentation, ability to play 
[T] on Free Internet Chess Server etc.)
