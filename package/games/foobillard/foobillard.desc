[I] a GL game of pool

[T] FooBillard is a free OpenGL-billard game for Linux with realistic 
[T] physics, AI-player and many gametypes like pool carambol or snooker. 
[T] Why foo? Well, actually I had this logo (F.B.- Florian Berger) and 
[T] then foo sounds a bit like pool (Somehow I wasn't quite attracted by 
[T] the name FoolBillard) The main physics is quite mature but not yet 
[T] perfect. If you are a billard- pro and you're missing some physics, 
[T] please tell the author.
