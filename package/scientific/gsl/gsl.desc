[I] The GNU Scientific Library

[T] The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
[T] numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
[T] team in C, and are meant to present a modern Applications Programming
[T] Interface (API) for C programmers, while allowing wrappers to be written
[T] for very high level languages.
