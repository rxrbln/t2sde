[I] High-level language based on LAPACK Fortran libraries

[T] GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
[T] computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving
[T] linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other
[T] numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with
[T] Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language. This is the
[T] development release. There is an older stable release, but most develop-
[T] ment in octave is in expanding functionality and compatibility. This
[T] code should be highly usable by the time it is allowed into the develop-
[T] ment release from CVS.
