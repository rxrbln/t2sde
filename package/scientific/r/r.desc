[I] Project for Statistical Computing

[T] R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
[T] It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
[T] which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
[T] Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a
[T] different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but
[T] much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
