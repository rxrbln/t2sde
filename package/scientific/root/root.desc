[I] An Object-Oriented Data Analysis Framework

[T] The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the functionality
[T] needed to handle and analyse large amounts of data in a very efficient way.
[T] Having the data defined as a set of objects, specialised storage methods
[T] are used to get direct access to the separate attributes of the selected
[T] objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are
[T] histograming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function
[T] evaluation, minimisation, graphics and visualization classes to allow the
[T] easy setup of an analysis system that can query and process the data
[T] interactively or in batch mode.
