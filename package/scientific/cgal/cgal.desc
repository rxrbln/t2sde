[I] Computational Geometry Algorithms Library

[T] The goal of the CGAL Open Source Project is to provide easy access
[T] to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a
[T] C++ library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric
[T] computation, such as: computer graphics, scientific visualization,
[T] computer aided design and modeling, geographic information
[T] systems, molecular biology, medical imaging, robotics and motion
[T] planning, mesh generation, numerical methods...
