[I] Free Scientific Software Package

[T] Scilab (developped since 1989 by Scilab Group) is a scientific software
[T] package for numerical computations providing a powerful open computing
[T] environment for engineering and scientific applications.
[T]
[T] Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions with the possibility
[T] to add interactively programs from various languages (C, Fortran...).
[T] It has sophisticated data structures (including lists, polynomials,
[T] rational functions, linear systems...), an interpreter and a high level
[T] programming language.
[T]
[T] According to the Free Software Foundation, Scilab is not a free software.
