[I] The GNU MP (multiple precision arithmetic) library

[T] GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
[T] integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  It has a rich set
[T] of functions, and the functions have a regular interface.
[T]
[T] GNU MP is designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands and
[T] for huge operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic
[T] arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, by carefully optimized assembly
[T] code for the most common inner loops for a lots of CPUs, and by a general
[T] emphasis on speed (instead of simplicity or elegance).
[T]
[T] The speed of GNU MP is believed to be faster than any other similar library.
[T] The advantage for GNU MP increases with the operand sizes for certain
[T] operations, since GNU MP in many cases has asymptotically faster algorithms.
