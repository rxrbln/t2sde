[T] ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and
[T] visualization application. ParaView users can quickly build
[T] visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and
[T] quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be done
[T] interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView's batch
[T] processing capabilities.
[T] 
[T] ParaView was developed to analyze extremely large datasets using
[T] distributed memory computing resources. It can be run on
[T] supercomputers to analyze datasets of terascale as well as on laptops
[T] for smaller data.
