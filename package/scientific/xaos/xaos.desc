[I] A real-time interactive fractal explorer

[T] XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer. It
[T] displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time fractals) and
[T] allows you to zoom smoothly into the fractal. Various coloring modes
[T] are provided for both the points inside and outside the selected
[T] set. In addition, switching between Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types
[T] and on-the-fly plane switching is provided. Features an ASCII output
