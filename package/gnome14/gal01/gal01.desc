[I] GNOME Application Libs

[T] This module contains some library functions that came from Gnumeric and
[T] Evolution.  The idea is to reuse the code across various larger GNOME
[T] applications that might want to use it.  The API is not frozen and might
[T] change at any time.  Larger class renaming might happen at any point
[T] without notice.

[T] Needed by gtkhtml, encompass and evolution.
