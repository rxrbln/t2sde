[I] Gnome library for HTTP 1.1 requests

[T] The gHTTP library is a GNOME library for making HTTP 1.1
[T] requests. It is designed to be simple and easy to use while still
[T] allowing you to get your feet wet at the protocol layer if
[T] you have to. It is also designed with graphical, non-threaded
[T] applications in mind. You should be able to use the library in
[T] your application and never block waiting to send or recieve
[T] data to a remote server. The main thread of execution should
[T] always be available to refresh its display. This library is
[T] fully compliant with HTTP 1.1 as defined in the draft 5 update
[T] of RFC 2068.
