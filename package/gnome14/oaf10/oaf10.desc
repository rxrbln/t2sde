[I] The GNOMEs Object Activation Framework

[T] OAF is the new Object Activation Framework for GNOME. OAF has a
[T] similar purpose to gnorba, the GNOME 1.x CORBA activation library, and
[T] will replace it for GNOME 2.0.
[T] 
[T] It allows you to do much more powerful activation queries than gnorba.
[T] Each server is described by an XML file that defines it's
[T] attributes. When querying or activating, one may specify complex
[T] requirements using the OAF query language.
