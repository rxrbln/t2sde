[I] A GNOME plot library and program

[T] Guppi is a plot program with integrated statistics capabilities. It is
[T] designed to have multiple frontends; at the moment, two of them are up
[T] and running: a standalone Gnome frontend, and an embeddable Gnome
[T] component. The embeddable component is intended to provide plot
[T] capabilities to other programs in the Gnome Workshop office suite,
[T] notably the Gnumeric spreadsheet.  The standalone version is
[T] scriptable via Guile, and is designed to be a sort of data
[T] visualization laboratory with lots of statistical capabilities built
[T] in.
