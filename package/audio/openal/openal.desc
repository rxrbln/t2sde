[I] Open Audio Library

[T] OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open, 
[T] vendor- neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily 
[T] spatialized audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application 
[T] developers and desktop users that rely on portable standards like 
[T] OpenGL, for games and other multimedia applications. OpenAL is 
[T] already supported by a number of hardware vendors and developers.
