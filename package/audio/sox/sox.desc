[I] Sound eXchange

[T] SoX (aka Sound eXchange) translates sound samples between different file
[T] formats and optionally applies various sound effects. SoX is intended as
[T] the Swiss Army Knife of sound processing tools. It doesn't do anything very
[T] well, but sooner or later it comes very handy.
