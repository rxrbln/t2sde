[I] A tool to discover detailed model information about an Apple(TM) iPod(TM)

[T] PodSleuth is a tool to discover detailed model information about an
[T] Apple(TM) iPod (TM). Its primary role is to be run as a callout by HAL
[T] because root access is needed to scan the device for required
[T] information. When the model information is discovered, it is merged
[T] into HAL as properties for other applications to use.
