[I] A graphical program for editing, playing and recording sound files

[T] mhWaveEdit is a graphical program for editing, playing and recording sound
[T] files. It is lightweight, portable, user-friendly and handles large files
[T] very well. The program itself has only simple editing features such as
[T] cut'n'paste and volume adjustment but it can also use Ladspa effect
[T] plugins and the effects provided by the SoX application. It can also
[T] support additional file formats besides wav through libsndfile and
[T] mp3/ogg import and export through lame and oggenc/oggdec.
