[I] LADSPA plugins for amp modeling, stomp-boxes and others

[T] caps, the C* Audio Plugin Suite, is a collection of refined LADSPA units
[T] including instrument amplifier emulation, stomp-box classics, versatile
[T] 'virtual analog' oscillators, fractal oscillation, reverb, equalization
[T] and others.
[T] 
[T] Most of the suite is of Tim's own invention, while some plugins are
[T] rewrites of existing designs, included because of their excellence or
[T] interest. Inspiring code was authored by (in no particular order):
[T] Andrew Simper, Perry Cook, Gary Scavone, Steve Harris, Richard Dobson,
[T] Bram de Jong and others.
