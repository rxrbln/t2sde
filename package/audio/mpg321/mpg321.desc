[I] A simple CML mp3 player

[T] mpg321 is a free replacement for mpg123, a very popular command-line
[T] mp3 player. mpg321 is used for frontends, as an mp3 player and as an
[T] mp3 to wave file decoder (primarily for use with CD-recording software.)
[T] In all of these capacities, mpg321 can be used as a drop-in replacement
[T] for mpg123.
[T]
[T] It uses code from the MAD distribution by Rob Leslie; XMMS; and plaympeg
[T] from the SMPEG distribution.
