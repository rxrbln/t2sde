[I] Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high quality

[T] It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so that you won't be
[T] able to hear differences between the original wave file and the much smaller MPC file.
[T] It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms, but since 1997 it has rapidly
[T] developed and vastly improved and is now at an advanced stage in which it contains
[T] heavily optimized and patentless code.
