[I] A JACK Audio Mastering interface

[T] JAMin is a realtime mastering processor designed to bring out the detail
[T] in recorded music and provide the final layer of polish. Every effort
[T] has been made to ensure a clean, distortion-free signal path. All
[T] processing elements use linear-phase filtering, ensuring that no phase
[T] distortion is introduced. JAMin uses the JACK Audio Connection Kit, a
[T] low-latency audio server, which can connect a number of different
[T] applications to an audio device, and also allow them to share audio
[T] among themselves.
