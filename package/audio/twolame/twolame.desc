[I] An MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder

[T] TwoLAME is an optimised MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder based on
[T] tooLAME by Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10 code
[T] and portions of LAME. TwoLAME includes libtwolame, a fully thread-safe
[T] shared library with an API very similar to LAME's.
