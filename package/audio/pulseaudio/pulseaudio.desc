[I] Yet another sound server for Unix

[T] PulseAudio is a sound server for Linux and other Unix-like operating
[T] systems. It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement for the
[T] Enlightened Sound Daemon (esound or esd). In addition to the features
[T] esound provides, PulseAudio has an extensible plugin architecture,
[T] support for more than one sink per source, better low-latency behavior,
[T] the ability to be embedded into other software, a completely asynchronous
[T] C API, a simple command line interface for reconfiguring the daemon while
[T] running, flexible and implicit sample type conversion and resampling,
[T] and a "Zero-Copy" architecture.
