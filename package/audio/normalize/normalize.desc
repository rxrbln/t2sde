[I] An audio file volume normalizer

[T] normalize is a tool for adjusting the volume of audio files to a
[T] standard level. This is useful for things like creating mixed CD's and
[T] mp3 collections, where different recording levels on different albums
[T] can cause the volume to vary greatly from song to song.
