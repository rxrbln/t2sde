[I] A Sample Rate Converter library for audio

[T] Libsamplerate is a Sample Rate Converter for audio. One example of where
[T] such a thing would be useful is converting audio from the CD sample rate
[T] of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz sample rate used by DAT players. 
[T]
[T] Libsamplerate is capable of arbitrary and time varying conversions; from
[T] downsampling by a factor of 12 to upsampling by the same factor. Arbitrary
[T] in this case means that the ratio of input and output sample rates can be
[T] an irrational number. The conversion ratio can also vary with time for
[T] speeding up and slowing down effects. 
[T]
[T] Libsamplerate provides a small set of converters to allow quality to be
[T] traded off against computation cost. The current best converter provides
[T] a signal-to-noise ratio of 97dB with -3dB passband extending from DC to
[T] 96% of the theoretical best bandwidth for a given pair of input and
[T] output sample rates.
