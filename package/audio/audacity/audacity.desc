[I] A cross-platform multitrack audio editor

[T] Audacity is a cross-platform multitrack audio editor. It allows you to
[T] record sounds directly or to import Ogg, WAV, AIFF, AU, IRCAM, or MP3
[T] files. It features a few simple effects, all of the editing features you
[T] should need, and unlimited undo. The GUI was built with wxWindows and
[T] the audio I/O currently uses OSS under Linux.
