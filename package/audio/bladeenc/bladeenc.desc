[I] A free MP3 encoder

[T] BladeEnc is a freeware MP3 encoder. It is based on the same ISO
[T] compression routines as mpegEnc, so you can expect roughly the same, or
[T] better, quality. The main difference is the appearance and speed.
[T] BladeEnc doesn't have a nice, user-friendly interface like mpegEnc, but it
[T] is more than three times faster.
