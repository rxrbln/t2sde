[I] Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Plugins

[T] ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) is the next generation
[T] Linux Sound API. It may go into the devel 2.5 Kernel.
[T] It provides much finer (->better) access to the sound hardware,
[T] has a unbeatable mixer api and supports stuff like multi track
[T] hardware, digital outs and ins, uninterleaved sound data access
[T] ... ... and an oss emulation layer (for the old apps).
[T] It is (not looking to the last major api changes) the prefered
[T] api for professional sound apps under Linux. (Lets hope they'll
[T] come.)
