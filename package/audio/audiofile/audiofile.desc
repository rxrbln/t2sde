[I] A library for accessing various audio file formats

[T] This Audio File Library is an implementation of the SGI Audio File
[T] library.  Since the latter is specified ambiguously in places, I've
[T] taken some liberties in interpreting certain such ambiguities.  At the
[T] present, not all features of the SGI Audio File library are
[T] implemented.  I feel, though, that this implementation of the Audio
[T] File Library offers enough functionality to be useful for general
[T] tasks.
[T] 
[T] This library allows the processing of audio data to and from audio
[T] files of many common formats (currently AIFF, AIFC, WAVE, and
[T] NeXT/Sun).
