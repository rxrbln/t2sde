[I] Disk-At-One CD creation tool

[T] Cdrdao creates audio and data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode
[T] driven by a description file called toc-file. In DAO mode it is
[T] possible to create non standard track pre-gaps that have other
[T] lengths than 2 seconds and contain nonzero audio data.
[T] Is is a CML tool like cdrecord, but also includes a gtk+ frontend
[T] (gcdmaster).
