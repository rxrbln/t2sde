[I] A shoutcast-compatible stream ripper

[T] Streamripper records shoutcast-compatible streams. For shoutcast style
[T] streams it finds the "meta data" or track separation data, and uses that as
[T] a marker for where the track should be separated. The MP3 data is decoded
[T] and scanned for a silent point, which is where tracks will be created.
