[I] a redesign of the XMMS music player

[T] XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS music player. It features a
[T] client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user
[T] interfaces, both textual and graphical. All common audio formats
[T] are supported using plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible
[T] media library to organize your music.
