[I] The audio connection kit

[T] JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for the
[T] GNU/Linux operating system. It can connect a number of different
[T] applications to an audio device, as well as allowing them to share
[T] audio between themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes
[T] (ie. as normal applications), or can they can run within the JACK
[T] server (ie. as a "plugin").
[T]
[T] JACK is different from other audio server efforts in that it has been
[T] designed from the ground up to be suitable for professional audio work.
[T] This means that it focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of
[T] all clients, and low latency operation.
