[I] A real-time C++ convolution library using FFT based convolution

[T] Libzita-convolver is a real-time C++ convolution library using FFT based
[T] convolution with non-uniform partition sizes: small ones at the start of
[T] the impulse response and building up to the most efficient size further on.
[T] It can perform zero-delay processing of very long IRs (e.g. reverbs) with
[T] moderate CPU load. The calculations are distributed over up to five
[T] threads, one for each partition size, running at priorities equal to or
[T] just below that of the calling thread. This ensures that even when multiple
[T] instances are active at the same time, CPU resources will be allocated in
[T] the optimum way.
