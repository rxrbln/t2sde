[I] A virtualization API

[T] Libvirt is a library for management of virtualized operating
[T] systems. Initially supporting the Xen hypervisor, it provides a generic
[T] driver backend to allow implementations for management of arbitrary
[T] hypervisors (QEMU, UML, etc). The library aims to provide a long term
[T] stable API to isolate applications from instability in the APIs of the
[T] underlying virtualization technology. The core library API is written in
[T] C, with bindings for Python and a command line tool for shell scripting
[T] also provided. The library allows either full read-write access to
[T] the hypervisor, or for unprivileged use a secure read-only channel
[T] (eg for monitoring).
