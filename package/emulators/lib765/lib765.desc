[I] Lib765 is a floppy controller emulation library

[T] Lib765 is the floppy controller emulation from JOYCE, separately packaged.
[T] It is (in some sense) the reverse of LibDSK (library for accessing discs
[T] and disc image files). It converts uPD765a commands into LibDSK API calls.
[T] It should come in handy if you're writing a PCW, CPC or Spectrum +3
[T] emulator.
