[I] A x86 PC emulator for running old DOS games

[T] DOSBox uses SDL to emulate the PC hardware 
[T] required for running old DOS games. This 
[T] includes a 386 processor, an S3/Trio video card 
[T] with some tweaks to allow for older display 
[T] hardware like the Tandy, a Sound Blaster Pro, 
[T] the PC speaker, Tandy 3-sound, CMS/GameBlaster, 
[T] Disney Sound Source, and MIDI. DOS emulation is 
[T] integrated. It is possible to mount local 
[T] directories as drives inside the emulator.
