[I] Linux virtual machines, with a focus on running containers

[T] Lima launches Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing and port
[T] forwarding (similar to WSL2). The original goal of Lima was to promote
[T] containerd including nerdctl to Mac users, but Lima can be used for
[T] non-container applications as well.
