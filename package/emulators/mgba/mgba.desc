[I] An open-source Game Boy Advance emulator

[T] mGBA is a new generation of Game Boy Advance emulator. The project started
[T] in April 2013 with the goal of being fast enough to run on lower end
[T] hardware than other emulators support, without sacrificing accuracy or
[T] portability. Even in the initial version, games generally played without
[T] problems. mGBA has only gotten better since then, and now boasts being
[T] the most accurate GBA emulator around.
[T]
[T] Further along in development mGBA gained Game Boy support and eventually is
[T] planned to have DS support too. Other goals include accurate enough
[T] emulation to provide a development environment for homebrew software, a good
[T] workflow for tool-assist runners, and a modern feature set for emulators
[T] that older emulators may not support.
