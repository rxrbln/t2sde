[I] LibDSK is a library for accessing discs and disc image files

[T] Libdsk is a library for accessing discs and disc image files. It is intended
[T] for use in emulator tools, converting between real floppy discs and disc
[T] images, as CPCTRANS/PCWTRANS do under DOS. Filesystems utilities, such as
[T] CPMTOOLS, allowing the use of CPMTOOLS on emulator .dsk images, and, it's
[T] also possible to use libdsk as part of an emulator's floppy controller, thus
[T] giving the emulator, transparent access to .dsk files or real discs.
