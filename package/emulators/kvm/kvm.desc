[I] Kernel (and Qemu) based Virtual Machine

[T] KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
[T] for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT
[T] or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides
[T] the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module,
[T] kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although
[T] work is underway to get the required changes upstream. 
[T]
[T] Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux
[T] or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware:
[T] a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.
