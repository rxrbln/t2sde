[I] An ia64 instruction set simulator

[T] Ski is an IA-64 instruction set simulator, originally written by the
[T] Hewlett-Packard Company. It simulates the IA-64 architecture as defined by
[T] the Intel Itanium 2 architecture manuals. This is not a full platform
[T] simulator; i.e., no system chipset or PCI bus simulation is done. However,
[T] ski supports the full instruction set of the architecture, including
[T] privileged instructions and associated semantics.
