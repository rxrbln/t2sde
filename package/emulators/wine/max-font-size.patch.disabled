In some situations there seem to be problems how to scale a font. A maximal
size of 1000 pixels is assumed which, however, will result in a vast system
load if an application constantly hits this issues. To significantly decrease
CPU and memory utilization for those applications (such as the Finereader OCR
engine) a maximal size of 100 pixels is appropriate.

Please note that this is _NOT_ a bug-fix, and just lowers an articifial
limit that already is a work around.
