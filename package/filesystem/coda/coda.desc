[I] Advanced networked filesystem

[T] Coda is a distributed filesystem with its origin in AFS2. It has
[T] many features that are very desirable for network filesystems. 
[T] Currently, Coda has several features not found elsewhere.
[T]
[T]   1. disconnected operation for mobile computing
[T]   2. is freely available under a liberal license
[T]   3. high performance through client side persistent caching
[T]   4. server replication
[T]   5. security model for authentication, encryption and access control
[T]   6. continued operation during partial network failures in server network
[T]   7. network bandwith adaptation
[T]   8. good scalability
[T]   9. well defined semantics of sharing, even in the presence of network
[T]      failures
[T]
[T] NOTE: The basic setup and functionallity works for me. But it might not
[T]       work for you at all - or burn all your data! - You should definitely
[T]       read the documentation at: http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu before you
[T]       start playing! I also experienced some performance problems with
[T]       sftp protocol Coda uses ...
