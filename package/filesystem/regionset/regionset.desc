[I] A tool that adjusts or shows the region code of DVD drives

[T] Regionset allows you to check and set the region code of DVD drives.
[T] This program is needed by everyone with a new DVD drive that doesn't
[T] have a region code set, since the drive will only play Video DVDs
[T] when the region code has been set once.
