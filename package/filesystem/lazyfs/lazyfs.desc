[I] LazyFS kernel module for Zero Install

[T] The Zero Install system makes software installation not merely easy,
[T] but unnecessary. Users run their applications directly from the
[T] Internet from the software author's pages.
[T] Caching makes this as fast as running a normal application after
[T] the first time, and allows off-line use.
