[I] Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem

[T] The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of other
[T] utilities for administering XFS filesystems.
[T]
[T] Xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
[T] backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
[T] storage medium. It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
[T] dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
[T] attributes. Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
[T] thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
[T] and also between IRIX machines.
[T]
[T] Xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
[T] full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups can then
[T] be layered on top of the full backup. Single files and directory
[T] subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.
