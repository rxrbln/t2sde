[I] A file search tool based on meta-data

[T] Doodle is a desktop search engine for Linux. It searches your hard drive
[T] for files using pattern matching on meta-data. It extracts file-format
[T] specific meta-data using libextractor and builds a suffix tree to index
[T] the files. The index can then be searched rapidly. It is similar to
[T] locate, but can take advantage of information such as ID3 tags. It is
[T] possible to do full-text indexing using the appropriate libextractor
[T] plugins. It also supports using FAM to keep the database up-to-date.
