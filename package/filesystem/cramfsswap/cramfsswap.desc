[I] Swap endianess of a cram filesystem

[T] Cramfs is a highly compressed and size optimized linux filesystem which is
[T] mainly used for embedded applications. The problem with cramfs is that it
[T] is endianess sensitive, meaning you can't mount a cramfs for a big endian
[T] target on a little endian machine and vice versa. This is often especially
[T] a problem in the development phase.
[T]
[T] Cramfsswap provides a solution by allowing to swap the endianess of a
[T] cramfs filesystem.
