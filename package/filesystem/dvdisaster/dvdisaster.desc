[I] CD and DVD data recovery ans defect analysis

[T] Dvdisaster provides a margin of safety against data loss on CD and DVD
[T] media caused by aging or scratches. Dvdisaster creates error correction
[T] codes to compensate read errors which are not correctable in the CD/DVD
[T] drive.
[T] Dvdisaster tries to read as much data as possible from defective media.
[T] Afterwards unreadable sectors are recovered using the previously created
[T] error correction code. The maximum error correction capacity is
[T] user-selectable.
