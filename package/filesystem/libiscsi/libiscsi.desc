[I] A client-side library to implement the iSCSI protocol

[T] Libiscsi is a client-side library to implement the iSCSI protocol that
[T] can be used to access the resources of an iSCSI target. The library
[T] is fully asynchronous with regards to iSCSI commands and SCSI tasks,
[T] but a synchronous layer is also provided for ease of use for simpler
[T] applications. The utils directory contains a handful of useful iSCSI
[T] utilities such as logging in to and enumerating all targets on a
[T] portal and all devices of a target. The examples directory contains
[T] example implementation of how to access both the synchronous and
[T] asynchronous APIs of libiscsi.
