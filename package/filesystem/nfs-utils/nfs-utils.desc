[I] Linux NFS client and server utilities

[T] The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
[T] related tools, which provides a much higher level of performance than the
[T] traditional Linux NFS server used by most users.
[T] 
[T] This package also contains the showmount program.  Showmount queries the
[T] mount daemon on a remote host for information about the NFS (Network File
[T] System) server on the remote host.  For example, showmount can display the
[T] clients which are mounted on that host.
