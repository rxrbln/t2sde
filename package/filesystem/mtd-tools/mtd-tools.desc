[I] A generic Linux subsystem for memory devices, especially Flash devices

[T] The aim of the system is to make it simple to provide a driver for new
[T] hardware, by providing a generic interface between the hardware drivers
[T] and the upper layers of the system.
[T] Hardware drivers need to know nothing about the storage formats used, such
[T] as FTL, FFS2, etc., but will only need to provide simple routines for read,
[T] write and erase. Presentation of the device's contents to the user in an
[T] appropriate form will be handled by the upper layers of the system.
