[I] A compressed read-only filesystem for Linux

[T] Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
[T] use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
[T] block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
[T] needed. The filesystem is currently stable and has been tested on PowerPC,
[T] i386, Sparc and ARM architectures.
