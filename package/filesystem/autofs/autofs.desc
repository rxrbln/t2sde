[I] A tool for automatically mounting and unmounting filesystems

[T] autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux. It performs a job
[T] similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead
[T] of pretending to be an NFS server. The result is simpler code, better
[T] reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything
[T] already mounted).
