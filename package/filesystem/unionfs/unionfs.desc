[I] A Stackable Unification File System

[T] A stackable unification file system, which can appear to merge the
[T] contents of several directories (branches), while keeping their physical
[T] content separate. Unionfs is useful for unified source tree management,
[T] merged contents of split CD-ROM, merged separate software package
[T] directories, data grids, and more. Unionfs allows any mix of read-only
[T] and read-write branches, as well as insertion and deletion of branches
[T] anywhere in the fan-out.
