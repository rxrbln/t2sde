[I] A filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol

[T] This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
[T] Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to
[T] set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.  On the client
[T] side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with
[T] ssh.
