[I] A pipeline data transfer meter

[T] pv (Pipe Viewer) is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress
[T] of data through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any normal pipeline
[T] between two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly data
[T] is passing through, how long it has taken, how near to completion it is,
[T] and an estimate of how long it will be until completion.
