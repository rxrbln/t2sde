[I] Add Group Spaces to Plone, in which group members can work together

[T] GrufSpaces is a product that provides a GroupSpace content type that is
[T] used to allow groups of users to work together on a project.
[T] GrufSpaces allows you to assign a "GroupMember" role to a user or a
[T] group using the standard sharing tab of Plone. GroupMembers can share
[T] documents inside the GrufSpace.
[T] GrufSpaces has its own custom groupspace-specific workflow.
