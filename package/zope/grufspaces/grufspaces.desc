[I] Add Group Spaces to Plone, in which group members can work together. 

[T] GrufSpaces is a product that provides a GroupSpace content type that is 
[T] used to allow groups of users to work together on a project. 
[T] GrufSpaces allows you to assign a "GroupMember" role to a user or a 
[T] group using the standard sharing tab of Plone. GroupMembers can share 
[T] documents inside the GrufSpace.
[T] GrufSpaces has its own custom groupspace-specific workflow.
