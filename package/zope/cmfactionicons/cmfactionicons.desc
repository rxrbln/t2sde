[I] A product that which build icon bars for a set of actions of Zope

[T] This product is a add-on for the Zope Content Management Framework (CMF).
[T] It should be useful with Plone, CPS, and other CMF-derived extensions, as
[T] well. The product provides:
[T]
[T] * A new tool, portal_actionicons, which serves as a registry mapping
[T]   object actions (using category and action ID) to a descriptive title,
[T]   a priority, and an icon ID. The tool post-processes a set of actions
[T]   (i.e., those generated by the portal_actions tool), decorating them
[T]   with additional information, and sorting them according to priority.
[T] * ZPT macros which build either horizontal or vertical icon bars for a
[T]   set of actions.
