[I] PloneiCalendar handles calendar files in Plone

[T] between applications of your choice whether they are personal
[T] information managers, email systems or web browsers.
[T] Once an iCalendar is created in Plone, you can share it with other
[T] users or groups, browse it by day, week and month or modify it by
[T] using standard calendar applications like Mozilla calendar or iCal.
