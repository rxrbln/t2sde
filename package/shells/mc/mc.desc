[I] The Midnight Commander visual shell

[T] Midnight Commander is a visual shell much like a file manager, only with way
[T] more features.  It is text mode, but also includes mouse support if you are
[T] running GPM.  Its coolest feature is the ability to ftp, view tar, zip
[T] files, and poke into RPMs for specific files.  :-)
[T]
[T] This version includes many cleanups and has no dependency to X11.
