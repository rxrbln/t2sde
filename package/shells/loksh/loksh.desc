[I] A Linux port of OpenBSD's ksh

[T] Unlike other ports of ksh, loksh targets only one platform, follows
[T] upstream closely and keeps changes to a minimum. loksh does not add any
[T] extra features; this reduces the risk of introducing security
[T] vulnerabilities and makes loksh a good fit for resource-constrained systems.
