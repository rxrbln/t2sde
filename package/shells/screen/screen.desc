[I] Screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation

[T] Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal
[T] between several processes (typically interactive shells). Each virtual
[T] terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition,
[T] several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022
[T] standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets).
[T] There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a
[T] copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions between windows.
