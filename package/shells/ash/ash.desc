[I] NetBSD's ash (Almquist sh) for Linux

[T] Ash is a Bourne compatible shell. It is without job control only 62K in
[T] size. The slackware distribution has shown, that such a small shell can
[T] be useful for a good bootdisk. However it might not be as convienient
[T] for interactive use as bash, ksh or tcsh.
