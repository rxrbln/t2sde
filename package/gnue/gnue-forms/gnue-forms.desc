[I] GNUe's data-aware user-interface generator

[T] GNUe Forms is a data-aware user-interface generator. In more specific
[T] terms, Forms, using a clean XML-based definition, can display the same
[T] functional user interface in various physical mediums, whether GUI, HTML,
[T] console, or via a telephone-response system. Forms is designed from the
[T] ground up to describe a functional, database-backed interface, with no
[T] emphasis on particular widget sets. A form should be equally usable in
[T] a console/text-based environment as it is in a GUI setting.
