[I] Application Server for the GNUe tools

[T] The GNUe Application Server (AppServer) is the core of the n-tier variant
[T] of the GNU Enterprise system. To the front end (be it GNUe Forms, GNUe 
[T] Reports or any other tool), it provides user-defineable business objects
[T] with arbitary fields and methods. While transforming access to those fields
[T] and methods into database communication and calling of scripts, it cares
[T] about stability, security, speed, and consistency.
