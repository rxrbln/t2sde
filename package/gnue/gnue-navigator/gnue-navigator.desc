[I] Menuing system for GNUe Forms and Reports

[T] GNUe Navigator is a menuing system for GNUe Forms and Reports. It presents
[T] a consistent menuing interface (in GUI or Text) based on an XML "process
[T] definition." GNUe Navigator uses the GNUe Forms or GNUe Reports clients to
[T] run the actual forms and reports, so these corresponding tools must be
[T] installed.
