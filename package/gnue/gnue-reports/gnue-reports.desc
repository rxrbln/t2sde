[I] Platform and output-independent reporting system for GNUe

[T] GNUe Reports is a platform and output-independent reporting system. It
[T] reads an XML-based report definition and generates arbitrary XML output
[T] that can further be translated into any format for which there is an
[T] adapter. GNUe Reports currently has outputs for Text, HTML, Label Stock,
[T] and CSV -- with PDF, Postscript, and Gnumeric/Excel formats in the works.
[T] Reports can output directly to a file, as an email attachment, to a
[T] printer, or to a HylaFax server.
