[I] XMMS plugin to use NAS

[T] The Network Audio System is used on most NCD X-terminals and is sometimes part
[T] of the standard X distribution, primarily for getting the sound to the right
[T] place.
[T] 
[T] Be aware that you're sending upto 180 kb/sec over the network between your
[T] X-terminal and the machine you're running xmms on.  Don't blame me if some
[T] sysadmin kicks your butt for hogging the network.
[T] 
[T] The time indicator isn't very reliable; it might be off by as much as half
[T] a second, depending on your machine.  This is very hard to get right, because
[T] I don't know when the data actually reaches the other side of the network.
[T] 
[T] The low water mark doesn't seem to work 100%, so be sure to have a large
[T] enough playing buffer (5000 milliseconds or so should do)
[T] 
[T] The Network Audio System doesn't support separate left and right volume,
[T] so the balance slider will not work.
