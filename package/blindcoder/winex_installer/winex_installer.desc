[I] winex_installer

[T] This is an installer for the commercial version of winex.
[T] It does NOT come with winex or an implied license for winex.
[T] Also, it does not install the CVS-Version of winex, since Transgaming
[T] didn't want an other distribution to ship it.
[T] For details, please see the following mailing-list-archives:
[T] The initial Intent To Package:
[T] http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200205/msg01163.html
[T] A summary of the whole discussion:

[T] And some clarification from Transgaming's CEO:
[T] http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200205/msg02463.html
[T]
[T] To install this package you have to manually download both the recent
[T] winex-binaries and the recent Point-2-Play binaries (both in tar.gz)
[T] and then point to those binaries from within scripts/Config
