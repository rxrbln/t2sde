[I] plays the game of Go

[T] Recently GNU Go has been developed into a more sophisticated program
[T] playing at around the 16 kyu level on the NNGS Go server. The program
[T] builds cleanly on many platforms. An ASCII interface and an Emacs mode
[T] are also supported. This summer, for the first time, it participated in
[T] international tournament play. In the 21st Century Cup held at the US Go
[T] Congress, GNU Go placed 8th in a field of 12. This may not sound
[T] impressive but actually we were satisfied with its performance. GNU Go
[T] won 3 out of 6 games and two of the games it lost were close. Moreover
[T] it scored an upset win over former Ing Champion program Wulu. In the
[T] European Championship GNU Go placed second, winning 5 out of six rounds,
[T] and losing only to the undefeated GoAhead.
