[I] A KDE theme engine based on RedHat's BlueCurve

[T] This is a set of widget styles for KDE, GTK1, and GTK2 based apps. The
[T] underlying code is based upon Blue/FreeCurve - however, *extensive*
[T] modifications have been made.
[T] 
[T] The following is a list of some of the changes in this theme:
[T] 
[T]   * Use KDE colours/fonts - read in via ~/.qt/qtrc, a la Geramik
[T]   * Better check and radio buttons - consistant between Qt, Gtk1, and 
[T]     Gtk2
[T]   * Pushbuttons now depress
[T]   * Comboboxes - fixed arrow size, and remove line from underneath arrow
[T]   * New sliders
[T]   * Draw box around splitter
[T]   * Better KDE progress bar
[T]   * More consistent spinboxes
[T]   * Removed slashes - replaced with horiz/vert lines
[T]   * New toolbar/menu bar handles
[T]   * Shading of objects is now consistent between KDE and GTK apps - 
[T]     things like 3d frames, and pushbuttons, should now be exactly the 
[T]     same.
