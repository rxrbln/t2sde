[I] Customizable and lightweight notification-daemon

[T] Dunst is a lightweight replacement for the notification daemons provided
[T] by most desktop environments. It’s very customizable, isn’t dependent on
[T] any toolkits, and therefore fits into those window manager centric
[T] setups we all love to customize to perfection.
