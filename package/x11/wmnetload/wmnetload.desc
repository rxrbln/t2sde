[I] A windowmanager dockapp which monitors network interfaces 

[T] wmnetload is a network interface monitor dockapp for Window Maker. 
[T] It is designed to fit well with dockapps like wmcpuload and wmmemmon. 
[T] It tracks whether the interface is functioning and displays current 
[T] network interface throughput, along with an auto-scaling graph of 
[T] recent network activity (the graph separates upstream and downstream 
[T] traffic load cleanly without resorting to colors).
