[I] A toolkit to create OpenGL User Interfaces

[T] a multiplatform library for creating 3D user interfaces, based
[T] on OpenGL. With the help of this library, programmers can add in their
[T] own graphic application elements for the user interface and connect
[T] interface objects to their own programs with callbacks. In other
[T] words, GLI sits between the user and an OpenGL application.
