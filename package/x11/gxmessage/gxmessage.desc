[I] A utility for creating X11 dialog boxes

[T] Gxmessage is an xmessage clone for GTK based desktops. Gxmessage pops up
[T] a dialog window, displays a given message or question, then waits for the
[T] user's response. That response is returned as the program's exit code.
[T] Because gxmessage is a drop-in alternative to xmessage, gxmessage accepts
[T] any option xmessage would, and returns the same exit codes.
