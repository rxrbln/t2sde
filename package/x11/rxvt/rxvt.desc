[I] Lightweight Xterm replacement

[T] Rxvt is an 8-bit clean, colour xterm replacement that uses significantly
[T] less memory than a conventional xterm, mostly since it doesn't support
[T] toolkit configurability or Tek graphics, but also since features can be
[T] removed at compile-time to reflect your needs.
