[I] A dynamic window manager

[T] Wmii is the next generation of wmi. It is a highly customizable
[T] keyboard-and-mouse-driven X11 window manager that supports conventional,
[T] tabbed, and tiled window management with low memory usage and vi-like
[T] user interaction. Due to a complete rewrite, it is highly modularized
[T] and uses a new configuration and inter-process communication interface,
[T] which is oriented on the 9p protocol of the Plan9 operating system.
