[I] An OpenSourced clone of the GLUT library

[T] Freeglut is intended to be a 100% API-compatible clone, and is released
[T] under the Xfree license. The GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) is a widely
[T] used library for doing window control, keyboard, and mouse input, and
[T] other basic functions for OpenGL programs. However, GLUT is not
[T] OpenSourced - although it's source code is available under a somewhat
[T] ill-defined set of restrictions.
