[I] Cross-platform mouse/keyboard/clipboard sharing

[T] Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
[T] multiple computers with different operating systems without special
[T] hardware. It's intended for users with multiple computers on their desk
[T] since each system uses its own monitor(s). Just move the mouse off the
[T] edge of a screen to move to another screen; keyboard and mouse input is
[T] then redirected to the other screen. Synergy also lets you cut and paste
[T] between systems and it makes screen savers activate/deactivate in concert.
