[I] A library package of C functions that draws 3D surfaces

[T] GLE is a library package of C functions that draw extruded surfaces, inclu-
[T] ding surfaces of revolution, sweeps, tubes, polycones, polycylinders and
[T] helicoids. Generically, the extruded surface is specified with a 2D poly-
[T] line that is extruded along a 3D path.  A local coordinate system allows
[T] for additional flexibility in the primitives drawn.  Extrusions may be
[T] texture mapped in a variety of ways.  The GLE library generates 3D triangle
[T] coordinates, lighting normal vectors and texture coordinates as output.
[T] GLE uses the GL or OpenGL(R) API's to perform the actual rendering.
