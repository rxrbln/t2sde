[I] A set of cli-tools for desktop integration

[T] Xdg-utils is a set of command line tools that assist applications with a
[T] variety of desktop integration tasks. About half of the tools focus on
[T] tasks commonly required during the installation of a desktop application
[T] and the other half focuses on integration with the desktop environment
[T] while the application is running. Even if the desktop components of your
[T] application are limited to an installer, configuration or management
[T] tool, Xdg-utils provides you with an easy way to enhance the usage
[T] experience of your customers by improving the integration of these
[T] components in the user's environment. Best of all, Xdg-utils is provided
[T] as open source and free of charge.
