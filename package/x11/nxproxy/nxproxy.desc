[I] A X11 proxy with extensive compression support

[T] A X11 procy with extensive compression. In its simplest configuration,
[T] a session is run on a remote server by having a NX proxy listening to
[T] X traffic and compressing such traffic across a TCP/IP connection to a
[T] proxy peer running on the local client. X traffic is decompressed by
[T] the local proxy and forwarded to the X server.
[T]
[T] Besides compression of X protocol, nxproxy is able to tunnel SMB and
[T] multimedia channels, so it is possible to listen to music from the
[T] remote terminal server or make available local resources of the thin
[T] client to the remote session.
