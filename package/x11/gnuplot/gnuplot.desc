[I] The Gnuplot Plotting Utility

[T] Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility. It
[T] was originally intended as graphical program which would allow scientists
[T] and students to visualize mathematical functions and data.  Gnuplot
[T] supports many different types of terminals, plotters, and printers
[T] (including many color devices, and pseudo-devices like LaTeX) and is
[T] easily extensible to include new devices.
