[I] A tiling tabbed window manager designed with keyboard users in mind

[T] Ion is a tiling (no overlapping windows) window manager that also has
[T] PWM-style tabbed frames which can contain multiple client windows. These
[T] features help to keep windows organized and to switch quickly between
[T] them. Ion was designed primarily as an efficient and unobtrusive window
[T] manager for users who prefer the keyboard.
