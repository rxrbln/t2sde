[I] A GTK+ based file manager somewhat similar to Amiga DirectoryOpus 4

[T] A modern, powerful, flexible, and utterly configurable file manager for
[T] UNIX systems, written using the GTK+ toolkit. Internal support for most
[T] file operations (copy, move, rename, makedir etc.) and a powerful file
[T] recognition system. It has nothing to do with the Gentoo distribution.
