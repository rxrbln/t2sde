[I] Draws planets in a X11 window - similar to Xearth

[T] Xplanet is similar to Xearth, where an image of the earth is rendered
[T] into an X window.  Xplanet can display several different map
[T] projections, including Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, or
[T] rectangular, as well as a window with a globe the user can rotate
[T] interactively.  The other planets and some satellites may also be
[T] displayed.
