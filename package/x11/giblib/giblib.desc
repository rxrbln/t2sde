[I] A simple imlib2 wrapper library with linked lists and fontstyles

[T] Giblib is a simple library which wraps imlib2. It provides a wrapper
[T] to imlib2's context API, avoiding all the context_get/set calls, adds
[T] fontstyles to the truetype renderer and supplies a generic doubly-linked
[T] list and some string functions.
