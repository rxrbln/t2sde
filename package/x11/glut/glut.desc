[I] OpenGL Utility Toolkit

[T] GLUT (pronounced like the glut in gluttony) is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a
[T] window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs. It implemen-
[T] ts a simple windowing application programming interface (API) for OpenGL.
[T] GLUT makes it considerably easier to learn about and explore OpenGL pro-
[T] gramming. GLUT provides a portable API so you can write a single OpenGL
[T] program that works on both Win32 PCs and X11 workstations.
[T]
[T] GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs.
[T] While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL
[T] applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications re-
[T] quiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window
[T] system toolkits like Motif. GLUT is simple, easy, and small. My intent is
[T] to keep GLUT that way.
