[I] A full set of X11 documentation

[T] In addition to the manual and html pages, X.Org contains a full set
[T] of documentation (about 50MB). You may need it if you are a developer
[T] and program directly for X without using an extra toolkit, such as QT
[T] or GTK/GDK, or if you are setting up a X server.
