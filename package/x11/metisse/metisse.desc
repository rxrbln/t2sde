[I] An experimental X desktop with OpenGL capacity

[T] Metisse is an X-based window system designed with two goals in
[T] mind. First, it should make it easy for HCI researchers to design and
[T] implement innovative window management techniques. Second, it should
[T] conform to existing standards and be robust and efficient enough
[T] to be used on a daily basis, making it a suitable platform for the
[T] evaluation of the proposed techniques. Metisse is not focused on a
[T] particular kind of interaction (e.g. 3D) and should not be seen as
[T] a new desktop proposal. It is rather a tool for creating new types of
[T] desktop environments.
