[I] A font library for use with OpenGL

[T] FTGL is a free, open source library to enable developers to use
[T] arbitrary fonts in their OpenGL applications. Unlike other OpenGL
[T] font libraries FTGL uses standard font file formats so doesn't need a
[T] preprocessing step to convert the high quality font data into a lesser
[T] quality, proprietary format.
[T] FTGL uses the Freetype font library to open and 'decode' the fonts. It
[T] then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient for
[T] OpenGL rendering.
