[I] A NextSTEP alike window manager

[T] AfterStep is a Window Manager for X which started by emulating the
[T] NeXTSTEP look and feel, but which has been significantly altered
[T] according to the requests of various users. Many adepts will tell you
[T] that NeXTSTEP is not only the most visually pleasant interface, but also
[T] one of the most functional and intuitive out there. AfterStep aims to
[T] incorporate the advantages of the NeXTSTEP interface, and add additional
[T] useful features.
