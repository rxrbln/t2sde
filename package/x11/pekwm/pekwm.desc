[I] A X11 Window Manager

[T] The Pekwm Window Manager is written by Claes Nästen. The code
[T] is based on the aewm++ window manager, but it has
[T] evolved enough that it no longer resembles aewm++ at
[T] all. It also has an expanded feature-set, including
[T] window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), auto
[T] properties, xinerama and keygrabber that supports
[T] keychains, and much more.
