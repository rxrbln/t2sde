[I] A fullscreen gesture recognition program for X Windows

[T] Xstroke is a full-screen gesture recognition program written for the X
[T] Window System. It captures gestures that are performed with a pointer
[T] device, (such as a mouse, a stylus, or a pen/tablet), recognizes the
[T] gestures and performs actions based on the gestures. Xstroke has been
[T] developed on Linux systems, (i386 and StrongARM), but should be quite
[T] portable to any UNIX-like system with X.
