[I] The freedesktop.org shared MIME database

[T] The freedesktop.org shared MIME database unifies
[T] the MIME databases used by GNOME, KDE, and ROX.
[T] This means that applications only have to modify
[T] one database on installation, and users have a
[T] single place to make changes that will affect all
[T] applications.
