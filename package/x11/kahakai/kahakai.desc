[I] A fork of the Waimea window manager

[T] Kahakai is a fork of the Waimea window manager, with the intent to
[T] create a language agnostic scriptable window manager, while maintaining the
[T] original features of Waimea, and extending upon them. Kahakai is pronounced
[T] with the 'ca' in car, the 'ha' in hard, and 'ki' from kite.
