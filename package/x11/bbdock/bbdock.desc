[I] A general XWindow dock (ment for blackbox)

[T] BBDock is an application launcher for Blackbox (and others) that allows
[T] you to create application buttons in the slit/dock. It works with PNG
[T] files rather than XPM images. It supports alpha blending at 16, 24 and
[T] 32 bits color-depth. Also, the raise-window function is available to
[T] window managers which implement the EWMH specification.
