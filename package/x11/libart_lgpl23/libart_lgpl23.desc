[I] A library for high-performance 2D graphics

[T] Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics. It is currently
[T] being used as the antialiased rendering engine for the Gnome Canvas.
[T]
[T] Libart supports a very powerful imaging model, basically the same as
[T] SVG and the Java 2D API. It includes all PostScript imaging operations,
[T] and adds antialiasing and alpha-transparency. 
[T]
[T] Libart is also highly tuned for incremental rendering. It contains
[T] data structures and algorithms suited to rapid, precise computation
[T] of Region of Interest, as well as a two-phase rendering pipeline
[T] optimized for interactive display.
