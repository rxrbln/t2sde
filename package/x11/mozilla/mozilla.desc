[I] Fullfeatured (but fat and slow) web browser

[T] Mozilla is one of the most exciting WWW developments at this point.
[T] Completely redesigned from scratch it makes a stable and easily
[T] extensible web client.
[T]
[T] While Mozilla is standard compliant and has an excellent rendering
[T] engine, it's default XUL-based interface is considered to be over-
[T] crowded and bloated. On slower processors even trivial tasks such
[T] as pulling down a menu is less than responsive.
[T]
[T] There is a project (Galeon) which provides a small gtk+ based GUI
[T] for the excellent Mozilla HTML rendering engine called Gecko.
