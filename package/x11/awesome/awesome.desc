[I] A tiled window manager for X

[T] Awesome is a window manager for X. It manages windows in several
[T] layout modes, such as tiled or floating. Each layout can be applied
[T] dynamically. Windows can be grouped by tags, and each window can be
[T] tagged with one or multiple tags, and each tag can have its own layout.
