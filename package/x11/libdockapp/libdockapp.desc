[I] A library that provides a framework for developing dockapps

[T] The goal of the library is to provide a simple, yet clean interface and
[T] standardize the ways in which dockapps are developed. A dockapp developed
[T] using libDockApp will automatically behave well under most window managers
[T] and specially well under Window Maker.
