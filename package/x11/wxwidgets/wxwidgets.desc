[I] A portable widget library

[T] wxWidgets gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI applications
[T] on multiple platforms. Link with the appropriate library for your platform
[T] (Windows/Unix/Mac, others coming shortly) and compiler (almost any popular
[T] C++ compiler), and your application will adopt the look and feel appro-
[T] priate to that platform. On top of great GUI functionality, wxwidgets
[T] gives you: online help, network programming, streams, clipboard and drag
[T] and drop, multithreading, image loading and saving in a variety of popular
[T] formats, database support, HTML viewing and printing, and much much more.
