[I] A window manager that lets you say good-bye to the rodent

[T] Ratpoison is a simple window manager with no large library dependencies,
[T] no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no rodent dependence. It is
[T] largely modeled after GNU Screen, which has done wonders in the virtual
[T] terminal market. All interaction with the window manager is done through
[T] keystrokes. Ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering
[T] that cripples EMACS and other quality pieces of software. All windows
[T] are maximized and kept maximized to avoid wasting precious screen space.
