[I] Automatically locks your X11 after a given time

[T] Xautolock monitors console activity under the X window system, and
[T] fires up a program of your choice if nothing happens during a
[T] user configurable period of time. You can use this to automatically
[T] start up a screen locker in case you tend to forget to do so manually
[T] before having a coffee break.
