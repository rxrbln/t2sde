[I] A fast and transparent VT100 terminal emulator for X

[T] aterm is based upon rxvt v.2.4.8 with add ons of Alfredo Kojima's
[T] NeXT-ish scrollbars. Fast transparency functionality, background
[T] lightening/darkening or/and titinting(coloring). Original idea of
[T] using ParentRelative transparency mode belongs to Alfredo also,
[T] although code has been mostly reworked. It can also be integrated
[T] with AfterStep libasimage for pixmap loading from various formats.
[T]
[T] Rxvt is an 8-bit clean, colour xterm replacement that uses
[T] significantly less memory than a conventional xterm, mostly since
[T] it doesn't support toolkit configurability or Tek graphics, but also
[T] since features can be removed at compile-time to reflect your needs.
[T] Some rxvt features (compilation dependent): ANSI-color, bold/blink
[T] attributes modify foreground/background colours, scrollbars with arrow
[T] buttons, kanji and greek support, printer-pipe, XPM, JPEG and PNG
[T] backgrounds with on-the-fly scaling, user-definable menus.
