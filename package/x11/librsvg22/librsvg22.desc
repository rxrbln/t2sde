[I] a library implementing the SVG image format

[T] The librsvg library is a lightweight library for parsing and rendering
[T] vector-graphic files in SVG format (like the ones made by sodipodi). It
[T] also includes functions that render anti-aliased fonts using freetype,
[T] including caching of glyphs. It's used by Nautilus for drawing vector
[T] icons and anti-aliased type.
