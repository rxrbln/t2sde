[I] GTK+ frontend for mkisofs, mkhybrid, cdrecord, and cdlabelgen

[T] gcombust is a GTK+ frontend for mkisofs, mkhybrid, cdrecord, and
[T] cdlabelgen. It's written in C. It has primitive support for
[T] controlling the directory (root) structure and size of an image
[T] without copying files/symlinking or writing 10 lines of arguments. It
[T] can also maximize disk usage by hinting at which directories/files to
[T] use.
