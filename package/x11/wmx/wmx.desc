[I] A window manager for X. It's based on wm2

[T] wmx is a window manager for X. It's based on wm2, and it retains a 
[T] similar look and feel, but it's intended to provide an experimental 
[T] vehicle for features that fall comfortably outside the scope of the 
[T] manifesto for the original wm2.
