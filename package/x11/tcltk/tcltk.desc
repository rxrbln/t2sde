[I] The Tcl scripting language + The Tk toolkit

[T] Tcl provides a powerful platform for creating integration
[T] applications that tie together diverse applications, protocols,
[T] devices, and frameworks.  When paired with the Tk toolkit, Tcl
[T] provides the fastest and most powerful way to create GUI applications
[T] that run on PCs, Unix, and the Macintosh.  Tcl can also be used for a
[T] variety of web-related tasks and for creating powerful command
[T] languages for applications.
