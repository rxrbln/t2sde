[I] XVideo command line attribute control

[T] XVattr lets you list the available attributes associated with the Xv
[T] extension of X11. It also allows you to change the values of the
[T] attributes. This can be used to change brightness, contrast or stuff
[T] like migrating the overlay to the CRT2  and so on for programs that
[T] use Xv overlays.
