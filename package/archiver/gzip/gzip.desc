[I] The zip compression utility

[T] gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement
[T] for 'compress'. Its main advantages over compress are much better
[T] compression and freedom from patented algorithms. The GNU Project
[T] uses it as the standard compression program for its system.
[T]
[T] gzip currently uses by default the LZ77 algorithm used in zip 1.9 (the
[T] portable pkzip compatible archiver). The gzip format was however
[T] designed to accommodate several compression algorithms.
