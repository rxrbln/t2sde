[I] Tape backup and restore program with a friendly user interface

[T] Taper is a tape backup and restore program that provides a friendly user
[T] interface to allow backing/restoring files to a tape drive. Alternatively,
[T] files can be backed up to hard disk files. Selecting files for backup and
[T] restore is very similar to the Midnight Commander interface and allows easy
[T] traversal of directories. Recursively selected directories are supported.
[T] Incremental backup and automatic most recent restore are defaults settings.
[T] SCSI, ftape, zftape, and removable drives are supported.
