[I] A small, fast, real-time data compression library

[T] LibLZF is a very small, self-contained library that can be incorporated
[T] into applications where data compression would be nice but speed is
[T] more important. It can be used to add data compression in a painless way
[T] to any program. Likewise, a small and self-contained perl interface is
[T] available via CPAN (Compress::LZF).
