[I] A fast binary diff utility for executables

[T] EDelta is a XDelta-style binary diff utility that is optimized for
[T] executables, which have a very systematic way of changing between
[T] versions. It has not been thoroughly evaluated so far, but between two
[T] versions of Vim it produces a 30kB delta where XDelta needs 250kB.
