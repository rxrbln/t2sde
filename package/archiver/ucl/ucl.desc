[I] A portable lossless data compression library

[T] UCL is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
[T] Both the source code and the compressed data format are designed to
[T] be portable across platforms. UCL supports in-place decompression. It
[T] implements a number of compression algorithms that achieve an excellent
[T] compression ratio while allowing very fast decompression. Decompression
[T] requires no additional memory.
