[I] An extensible archiver

[T] XAR stands for eXtensible ARchiver. XAR is a new archive format, library,
[T] and archiver to meet modern archival needs. It can archive Extended
[T] Attributes and ACLs for Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X 10.4 systems and
[T] resource forks and Finder metadata on Mac OS X 10.3. XAR can extract
[T] files using either numeric (uid/gid) or symbolic (username/groupname)
[T] file ownerships, saving the hassle of remapping uids/gids to the correct
[T] users. Python bindings, Cocoa bindings, and a Finder Contextual Menu
[T] Plugin are available separately.
