[I] A fast compression library

[T] LZ4 is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
[T] It offers pretty fast compression and *extremly* fast decompression.
[T] Decompression requires no memory.
[T]
[T] In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
[T] competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at this very high
[T] speed.
