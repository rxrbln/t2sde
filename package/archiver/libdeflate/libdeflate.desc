[I] Fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and decompression

[T] libdeflate is heavily optimized. It is significantly faster than the zlib
[T] library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
[T] processors. In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression
[T] modes that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".
