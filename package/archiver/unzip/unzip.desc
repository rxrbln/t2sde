[I] PKUNZIP compatible compression utility

[T] UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format (also
[T] called "zipfiles").  Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP
[T] and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, the
[T] primary objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.
