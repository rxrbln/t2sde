[I] A multi-threaded bzip2/bunzip2 filter that isn't restricted to regular files

[T] Lbzip2 is a Pthreads-based parallel bzip2/bunzip2
[T] (compressor/decompressor) filter, passable to GNU tar with the
[T] --use-compress-program option. It isn't restricted to regular files
[T] on input, nor output. Successful splitting for decompression isn't
[T] guaranteed, just very likely (failure is detected). Splitting for
[T] compression and compression itself occur with fixed 900k block size.
[T] Lbzip2 strives to be portable by requiring UNIX 98 APIs only, beside
[T] an unmodified libbz2.
