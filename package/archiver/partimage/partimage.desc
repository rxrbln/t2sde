[I] A utility to save partitions into an image file

[T] Partition Image is a utility to save partitions (ext2/3fs, reiserfs,
[T] fat16, fat32, hpfs, ntfs) into an image file. Only used blocks of the
[T] partition are saved, and the image can be compressed in gzip or bzip2
[T] format. You can split the image into small files.
