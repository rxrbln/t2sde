[I] A file compression utility using the LZMA algorithm

[T] LZMA utils in a nutshell. Average compression ratio of LZMA is about
[T] 30% better than that of gzip, and 15% better than that of bzip2.
[T] Decompression speed is only little slower than that of gzip, being two
[T] to five times faster than bzip2. In fast mode, compresses faster than
[T] bzip2 with a comparable compression ratio. However achieving the best
[T] compression ratios takes four to even twelve times longer than with bzip2.
[T] However, this doesn't affect decompressing speed.
