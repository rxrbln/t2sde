[I] A cpio replacement with built-in compression

[T] Archiver & backup program with builtin compression. Afio makes cpio-
[T] format archives.  Afio can make compressed archives that are much
[T] safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.  Afio is best used as an
[T] `archive engine' in a backup script.
