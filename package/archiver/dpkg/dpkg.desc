[I] The debian package manager

[T] The `dpkg' suite contains the programs which handle Debian (.deb)
[T] packages. It was developed on Debian GNU/Linux but can be used on all
[T] Linux distributions and most Unix systems. The `dpkg' command can be
[T] used to install, remove and manage .deb binary packages, and it
[T] maintains a package database which gets updated on changes. It is also a
[T] front-end to the low-level `dpkg-deb' tool, which is oriented towards
[T] manipulating archives. However, the primary interface to dpkg is the
[T] `dselect' program, which is used to get and display packages for the
[T] user to select for (de)installation.
