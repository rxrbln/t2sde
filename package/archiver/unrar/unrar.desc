[I] Extract, test and view RAR archives 

[T] Unrar is a package to handle files compressed in the RAR format.
[T] Due to strange licensing issues this package can only view, test
[T] and extract files in a given archive, but not pack files. 
[T] But since we have far more advanced open-source compression utils
[T] it should be enough to extract the content when you get a RAR
[T] archive.
