[I] A cross-platform library to access SMBIOS/DMI information

[T] Libsmbios is a cross-platform library intended to be used to obtain common
[T] information available in a BIOS. Major features include the ability to
[T] update the BIOS on Dell systems (in conjunction with the Dell RBU Linux
[T] kernel driver), programmatic access to information in SMBIOS tables,
[T] and the ability to obtain Dell system-specific information such as the
[T] Dell System ID number, service tag, and asset tag. Future plans include
[T] APIs for $PIR and mptable mapping. There is a C API for some of the
[T] more commonly used functions, and example binaries to show off most of
[T] the facilities.
