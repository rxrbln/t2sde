[I] A stand-alone memory siagnostic program for x86

[T] Memtest86 is thorough, stand alone memory test for Intel i386 architecture
[T] systems. BIOS based memory tests are only a quick check and often miss
[T] failures that are detected by Memtest86. Memtest86 is it's own mini-os and
[T] can be booted using lilo, grub or directly from the bios (e.g. if written
[T] to the boot sector of a floppy disk).
[T]
[T] Bad memory or problems on the cpu<->memory bus are common reasons for
[T] the well-known 'Signal 11 while compiling the kernel' problem. Please
[T] read the Sig11 FAQ for details.
[T]
[T] The command 'memtest_install' can be used to create a memtest boot floppy.
