[I] The GRand Unified Bootloader as modified by Sun / OpenSolaris

[T] This package contains the Sun Microsystems / OpenSolaris fork
[T] of GRUB - the GRand Unified Bootloader.
[T]
[T] Although the T2 project and sponsors already invested significant
[T] resources to fix USB CD boot problems in the main T2 GRUB package,
[T] in 2008 new problems came up that where already fixed in the Sun
[T] OpenSolaris flavour. Additionally this version of GRUB implements
[T] PXE UNDI Network Stack support, and thus allows network booting on
[T] newer machines and chipsets, in contrast to the official version
[T] of GRUB which requires per-chipset drivers to access the NIC.
