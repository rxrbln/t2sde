[I] Generic boot loader for Linux on ix86 based PCs

[T] LILO (LInux LOader) is a basic system program which boots your
[T] Linux system. LILO loads the Linux kernel from a floppy or a
[T] hard drive, boots the kernel and passes control of the
[T] system to the kernel. LILO can also boot other operating systems.
