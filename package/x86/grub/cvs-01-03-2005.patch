-1.1 Overview
-============
-
-Briefly, a "boot loader" is the first software program that runs when a
-computer starts.  It is responsible for loading and transferring
-control to an operating system "kernel" software (such as Linux or GNU
-Mach).  The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of the operating
-system (e.g. a GNU system).
-
-   GNU GRUB is a very powerful boot loader, which can load a wide
-variety of free operating systems, as well as proprietary operating
-systems with chain-loading(1) (*note Overview-Footnote-1::). GRUB is
-designed to address the complexity of booting a personal computer; both
-the program and this manual are tightly bound to that computer platform,
-although porting to other platforms may be addressed in the future.
-
-   One of the important features in GRUB is flexibility; GRUB
-understands filesystems and kernel executable formats, so you can load
-an arbitrary operating system the way you like, without recording the
-physical position of your kernel on the disk. Thus you can load the
-kernel just by specifying its file name and the drive and partition
-where the kernel resides.
-
-   When booting with GRUB, you can use either a command-line interface
-(*note Command-line interface::), or a menu interface (*note Menu
-interface::). Using the command-line interface, you type the drive
-specification and file name of the kernel manually. In the menu
-interface, you just select an OS using the arrow keys. The menu is
-based on a configuration file which you prepare beforehand (*note
-Configuration::). While in the menu, you can switch to the command-line
-mode, and vice-versa. You can even edit menu entries before using them.
-
-   In the following chapters, you will learn how to specify a drive, a
-partition, and a file name (*note Naming convention::) to GRUB, how to
-install GRUB on your drive (*note Installation::), and how to boot your
-OSes (*note Booting::), step by step.
-
-   Besides the GRUB boot loader itself, there is a "grub shell" `grub'
-(*note Invoking the grub shell::) which can be run when you are in your
-operating system. It emulates the boot loader and can be used for
-installing the boot loader.
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Overview-Footnotes,  Up: Overview
-
-   (1) "chain-load" is the mechanism for loading unsupported operating
-systems by loading another boot loader. It is typically used for
-loading DOS or Windows.

-1.2 History of GRUB
-===================
-
-GRUB originated in 1995 when Erich Boleyn was trying to boot the GNU
-Hurd with the University of Utah's Mach 4 microkernel (now known as GNU
-Mach).  Erich and Brian Ford designed the Multiboot Specification
-(*note Multiboot Specification: (multiboot)Top.), because they were
-determined not to add to the large number of mutually-incompatible PC
-boot methods.
-
-   Erich then began modifying the FreeBSD boot loader so that it would
-understand Multiboot. He soon realized that it would be a lot easier to
-write his own boot loader from scratch than to keep working on the
-FreeBSD boot loader, and so GRUB was born.
-
-   Erich added many features to GRUB, but other priorities prevented him
-from keeping up with the demands of its quickly-expanding user base. In
-1999, Gordon Matzigkeit and Yoshinori K. Okuji adopted GRUB as an
-official GNU package, and opened its development by making the latest
-sources available via anonymous CVS. *Note Obtaining and Building
-GRUB::, for more information.
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Features,  Next: Role of a boot loader,  Prev: History,  Up: Introduction
-
-1.3 GRUB features
-=================
-
-The primary requirement for GRUB is that it be compliant with the
-"Multiboot Specification", which is described in *Note Multiboot
-Specification: (multiboot)Top.
-
-   The other goals, listed in approximate order of importance, are:
-
-   * Basic functions must be straightforward for end-users.
-
-   * Rich functionality to support kernel experts and designers.
-
-   * Backward compatibility for booting FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and
-     Linux. Proprietary kernels (such as DOS, Windows NT, and OS/2) are
-     supported via a chain-loading function.
-
-   Except for specific compatibility modes (chain-loading and the Linux
-"piggyback" format), all kernels will be started in much the same state
-as in the Multiboot Specification. Only kernels loaded at 1 megabyte or
-above are presently supported. Any attempt to load below that boundary
-will simply result in immediate failure and an error message reporting
-the problem.
-
-   In addition to the requirements above, GRUB has the following
-features (note that the Multiboot Specification doesn't require all the
-features that GRUB supports):
-
-Recognize multiple executable formats
-     Support many of the "a.out" variants plus "ELF". Symbol tables are
-     also loaded.
-
-Support non-Multiboot kernels
-     Support many of the various free 32-bit kernels that lack Multiboot
-     compliance (primarily FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Linux).
-     Chain-loading of other boot loaders is also supported.
-
-Load multiples modules
-     Fully support the Multiboot feature of loading multiple modules.
-
-Load a configuration file
-     Support a human-readable text configuration file with preset boot
-     commands. You can also load another configuration file dynamically
-     and embed a preset configuration file in a GRUB image file. The
-     list of commands (*note Commands::) are a superset of those
-     supported on the command-line. An example configuration file is
-     provided in *Note Configuration::.
-
-Provide a menu interface
-     A menu interface listing preset boot commands, with a programmable
-     timeout, is available. There is no fixed limit on the number of
-     boot entries, and the current implementation has space for several
-     hundred.
-
-Have a flexible command-line interface
-     A fairly flexible command-line interface, accessible from the menu,
-     is available to edit any preset commands, or write a new boot
-     command set from scratch. If no configuration file is present,
-     GRUB drops to the command-line.
-
-     The list of commands (*note Commands::) are a subset of those
-     supported for configuration files. Editing commands closely
-     resembles the Bash command-line (*note Bash: (features)Command
-     Line Editing.), with <TAB>-completion of commands, devices,
-     partitions, and files in a directory depending on context.
-
-Support multiple filesystem types
-     Support multiple filesystem types transparently, plus a useful
-     explicit blocklist notation. The currently supported filesystem
-     types are "BSD FFS", "DOS FAT16 and FAT32", "Minix fs", "Linux
-     ext2fs", "ReiserFS", "JFS", "XFS", and "VSTa fs". *Note
-     Filesystem::, for more information.
-
-Support automatic decompression
-     Can decompress files which were compressed by `gzip'. This
-     function is both automatic and transparent to the user (i.e. all
-     functions operate upon the uncompressed contents of the specified
-     files). This greatly reduces a file size and loading time, a
-     particularly great benefit for floppies.(1) (*note
-     Features-Footnote-1::)
-
-     It is conceivable that some kernel modules should be loaded in a
-     compressed state, so a different module-loading command can be
-     specified to avoid uncompressing the modules.
-
-Access data on any installed device
-     Support reading data from any or all floppies or hard disk(s)
-     recognized by the BIOS, independent of the setting of the root
-     device.
-
-Be independent of drive geometry translations
-     Unlike many other boot loaders, GRUB makes the particular drive
-     translation irrelevant. A drive installed and running with one
-     translation may be converted to another translation without any
-     adverse effects or changes in GRUB's configuration.
-
-Detect all installed RAM
-     GRUB can generally find all the installed RAM on a PC-compatible
-     machine. It uses an advanced BIOS query technique for finding all
-     memory regions. As described on the Multiboot Specification (*note
-     Multiboot Specification: (multiboot)Top.), not all kernels make
-     use of this information, but GRUB provides it for those who do.
-
-Support Logical Block Address mode
-     In traditional disk calls (called "CHS mode"), there is a geometry
-     translation problem, that is, the BIOS cannot access over 1024
-     cylinders, so the accessible space is limited to at least 508 MB
-     and to at most 8GB. GRUB can't universally solve this problem, as
-     there is no standard interface used in all machines. However,
-     several newer machines have the new interface, Logical Block
-     Address ("LBA") mode. GRUB automatically detects if LBA mode is
-     available and uses it if available. In LBA mode, GRUB can access
-     the entire disk.
-
-Support network booting
-     GRUB is basically a disk-based boot loader but also has network
-     support. You can load OS images from a network by using the "TFTP"
-     protocol.
-
-Support remote terminals
-     To support computers with no console, GRUB provides remote terminal
-     support, so that you can control GRUB from a remote host. Only
-     serial terminal support is implemented at the moment.

-1.4 The role of a boot loader
-=============================
-
-The following is a quotation from Gordon Matzigkeit, a GRUB fanatic:
-
-     Some people like to acknowledge both the operating system and
-     kernel when they talk about their computers, so they might say
-     they use "GNU/Linux" or "GNU/Hurd".  Other people seem to think
-     that the kernel is the most important part of the system, so they
-     like to call their GNU operating systems "Linux systems."
-
-     I, personally, believe that this is a grave injustice, because the
-     _boot loader_ is the most important software of all. I used to
-     refer to the above systems as either "LILO"(1) (*note Role of a
-     boot loader-Footnote-1::) or "GRUB" systems.
-
-     Unfortunately, nobody ever understood what I was talking about;
-     now I just use the word "GNU" as a pseudonym for GRUB.
-
-     So, if you ever hear people talking about their alleged "GNU"
-     systems, remember that they are actually paying homage to the best
-     boot loader around... GRUB!
-
-   We, the GRUB maintainers, do not (usually) encourage Gordon's level
-of fanaticism, but it helps to remember that boot loaders deserve
-recognition.  We hope that you enjoy using GNU GRUB as much as we did
-writing it.

-
-2 Naming convention
-*******************
-
-The device syntax used in GRUB is a wee bit different from what you may
-have seen before in your operating system(s), and you need to know it so
-that you can specify a drive/partition.
-
-   Look at the following examples and explanations:
-
-     (fd0)
-
-   First of all, GRUB requires that the device name be enclosed with
-`(' and `)'. The `fd' part means that it is a floppy disk. The number
-`0' is the drive number, which is counted from _zero_. This expression
-means that GRUB will use the whole floppy disk.
-
-     (hd0,1)
-
-   Here, `hd' means it is a hard disk drive. The first integer `0'
-indicates the drive number, that is, the first hard disk, while the
-second integer, `1', indicates the partition number (or the PC slice
-number in the BSD terminology). Once again, please note that the
-partition numbers are counted from _zero_, not from one. This
-expression means the second partition of the first hard disk drive. In
-this case, GRUB uses one partition of the disk, instead of the whole
-disk.
-
-     (hd0,4)
-
-   This specifies the first "extended partition" of the first hard disk
-drive. Note that the partition numbers for extended partitions are
-counted from `4', regardless of the actual number of primary partitions
-on your hard disk.
-
-     (hd1,a)
-
-   This means the BSD `a' partition of the second hard disk. If you
-need to specify which PC slice number should be used, use something
-like this: `(hd1,0,a)'. If the PC slice number is omitted, GRUB
-searches for the first PC slice which has a BSD `a' partition.
-
-   Of course, to actually access the disks or partitions with GRUB, you
-need to use the device specification in a command, like `root (fd0)' or
-`unhide (hd0,2)'. To help you find out which number specifies a
-partition you want, the GRUB command-line (*note Command-line
-interface::) options have argument completion. This means that, for
-example, you only need to type
-
-     root (
-
-   followed by a <TAB>, and GRUB will display the list of drives,
-partitions, or file names. So it should be quite easy to determine the
-name of your target partition, even with minimal knowledge of the
-syntax.
-
-   Note that GRUB does _not_ distinguish IDE from SCSI - it simply
-counts the drive numbers from zero, regardless of their type. Normally,
-any IDE drive number is less than any SCSI drive number, although that
-is not true if you change the boot sequence by swapping IDE and SCSI
-drives in your BIOS.
-
-   Now the question is, how to specify a file? Again, consider an
-example:
-
-     (hd0,0)/vmlinuz
-
-   This specifies the file named `vmlinuz', found on the first
-partition of the first hard disk drive. Note that the argument
-completion works with file names, too.
-
-   That was easy, admit it. Now read the next chapter, to find out how
-to actually install GRUB on your drive.

-
-3 Installation
-**************
-
-In order to install GRUB as your boot loader, you need to first install
-the GRUB system and utilities under your UNIX-like operating system
-(*note Obtaining and Building GRUB::). You can do this either from the
-source tarball, or as a package for your OS.
-
-   After you have done that, you need to install the boot loader on a
-drive (floppy or hard disk). There are two ways of doing that - either
-using the utility `grub-install' (*note Invoking grub-install::) on a
-UNIX-like OS, or by running GRUB itself from a floppy. These are quite
-similar, however the utility might probe a wrong BIOS drive, so you
-should be careful.
-
-   Also, if you install GRUB on a UNIX-like OS, please make sure that
-you have an emergency boot disk ready, so that you can rescue your
-computer if, by any chance, your hard drive becomes unusable
-(unbootable).
-
-   GRUB comes with boot images, which are normally put in the directory
-`/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc'. If you do not use grub-install, then you need
-to copy the files `stage1', `stage2', and `*stage1_5' to the directory
-`/boot/grub', and run the `grub-set-default' (*note Invoking
-grub-set-default::) if you intend to use `default saved' (*note
-default::) in your configuration file. Hereafter, the directory where
-GRUB images are initially placed (normally `/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc')
-will be called the "image directory", and the directory where the boot

-3.1 Creating a GRUB boot floppy
-===============================
-
-To create a GRUB boot floppy, you need to take the files `stage1' and
-`stage2' from the image directory, and write them to the first and the
-second block of the floppy disk, respectively.
-
-   *Caution:* This procedure will destroy any data currently stored on
-the floppy.
-
-   On a UNIX-like operating system, that is done with the following
-commands:
-
-     # cd /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc
-     # dd if=stage1 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
-     1+0 records in
-     1+0 records out
-     # dd if=stage2 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 seek=1
-     153+1 records in
-     153+1 records out
-     #
-
-   The device file name may be different. Consult the manual for your
-OS.

-
-3.2 Installing GRUB natively
-============================
-
-*Caution:* Installing GRUB's stage1 in this manner will erase the
-normal boot-sector used by an OS.
-
-   GRUB can currently boot GNU Mach, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD
-directly, so using it on a boot sector (the first sector of a
-partition) should be okay. But generally, it would be a good idea to
-back up the first sector of the partition on which you are installing
-GRUB's stage1. This isn't as important if you are installing GRUB on
-the first sector of a hard disk, since it's easy to reinitialize it
-(e.g. by running `FDISK /MBR' from DOS).
-
-   If you decide to install GRUB in the native environment, which is
-definitely desirable, you'll need to create a GRUB boot disk, and
-reboot your computer with it. Otherwise, see *Note Installing GRUB
-using grub-install::.
-
-   Once started, GRUB will show the command-line interface (*note
-Command-line interface::). First, set the GRUB's "root device"(1)
-(*note Installing GRUB natively-Footnote-1::) to the partition
-containing the boot directory, like this:
-
-     grub> root (hd0,0)
-
-   If you are not sure which partition actually holds this directory,
-use the command `find' (*note find::), like this:
-
-     grub> find /boot/grub/stage1
-
-   This will search for the file name `/boot/grub/stage1' and show the
-devices which contain the file.
-
-   Once you've set the root device correctly, run the command `setup'
-(*note setup::):
-
-     grub> setup (hd0)
-
-   This command will install the GRUB boot loader on the Master Boot
-Record (MBR) of the first drive. If you want to put GRUB into the boot
-sector of a partition instead of putting it in the MBR, specify the
-partition into which you want to install GRUB:
-
-     grub> setup (hd0,0)
-
-   If you install GRUB into a partition or a drive other than the first
-one, you must chain-load GRUB from another boot loader. Refer to the
-manual for the boot loader to know how to chain-load GRUB.
-
-   After using the setup command, you will boot into GRUB without the
-GRUB floppy. See the chapter *Note Booting:: to find out how to boot
-your operating systems from GRUB.

-
-3.3 Installing GRUB using grub-install
-======================================
-
-*Caution:* This procedure is definitely less safe, because there are
-several ways in which your computer can become unbootable. For example,
-most operating systems don't tell GRUB how to map BIOS drives to OS
-devices correctly--GRUB merely "guesses" the mapping. This will succeed
-in most cases, but not always. Therefore, GRUB provides you with a map
-file called the "device map", which you must fix if it is wrong. *Note
-Device map::, for more details.
-
-   If you still do want to install GRUB under a UNIX-like OS (such as
-GNU), invoke the program `grub-install' (*note Invoking grub-install::)
-as the superuser ("root").
-
-   The usage is basically very simple. You only need to specify one
-argument to the program, namely, where to install the boot loader. The
-argument can be either a device file (like `/dev/hda') or a partition
-specified in GRUB's notation. For example, under Linux the following
-will install GRUB into the MBR of the first IDE disk:
-
-     # grub-install /dev/hda
-
-   Likewise, under GNU/Hurd, this has the same effect:
-
-     # grub-install /dev/hd0
-
-   If it is the first BIOS drive, this is the same as well:
-
-     # grub-install '(hd0)'
-
-   Or you can omit the parentheses:
-
-     # grub-install hd0
-
-   But all the above examples assume that GRUB should use images under
-the root directory. If you want GRUB to use images under a directory
-other than the root directory, you need to specify the option
-`--root-directory'. The typical usage is that you create a GRUB boot
-floppy with a filesystem. Here is an example:
-
-     # mke2fs /dev/fd0
-     # mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt
-     # grub-install --root-directory=/mnt fd0
-     # umount /mnt
-
-   Another example is when you have a separate boot partition which is
-mounted at `/boot'. Since GRUB is a boot loader, it doesn't know
-anything about mountpoints at all. Thus, you need to run `grub-install'
-like this:
-
-     # grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/hda
-
-   By the way, as noted above, it is quite difficult to guess BIOS
-drives correctly under a UNIX-like OS. Thus, `grub-install' will prompt
-you to check if it could really guess the correct mappings, after the
-installation. The format is defined in *Note Device map::. Please be
-quite careful. If the output is wrong, it is unlikely that your
-computer will be able to boot with no problem.
-
-   Note that `grub-install' is actually just a shell script and the
-real task is done by the grub shell `grub' (*note Invoking the grub
-shell::). Therefore, you may run `grub' directly to install GRUB,
-without using `grub-install'. Don't do that, however, unless you are
-very familiar with the internals of GRUB. Installing a boot loader on a
-running OS may be extremely dangerous.

-
-3.4 Making a GRUB bootable CD-ROM
-=================================
-
-GRUB supports the "no emulation mode" in the El Torito specification(1)
-(*note Making a GRUB bootable CD-ROM-Footnote-1::). This means that you
-can use the whole CD-ROM from GRUB and you don't have to make a floppy
-or hard disk image file, which can cause compatibility problems.
-
-   For booting from a CD-ROM, GRUB uses a special Stage 2 called
-`stage2_eltorito'. The only GRUB files you need to have in your
-bootable CD-ROM are this `stage2_eltorito' and optionally a config file
-`menu.lst'. You don't need to use `stage1' or `stage2', because El
-Torito is quite different from the standard boot process.
-
-   Here is an example of procedures to make a bootable CD-ROM image.
-First, make a top directory for the bootable image, say, `iso':
-
-     $ mkdir iso
-
-   Make a directory for GRUB:
-
-     $ mkdir -p iso/boot/grub
-
-   Copy the file `stage2_eltorito':
-
-     $ cp /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/stage2_eltorito iso/boot/grub
-
-   If desired, make the config file `menu.lst' under `iso/boot/grub'
-(*note Configuration::), and copy any files and directories for the
-disc to the directory `iso/'.
-
-   Finally, make a ISO9660 image file like this:
-
-     $ mkisofs -R -b boot/grub/stage2_eltorito -no-emul-boot \
-         -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o grub.iso iso
-
-   This produces a file named `grub.iso', which then can be burned into
-a CD (or a DVD).  `mkisofs' has already set up the disc to boot from
-the `boot/grub/stage2_eltorito' file, so there is no need to setup GRUB
-on the disc.  (Note that the `-boot-load-size 4' bit is required for
-compatibility with the BIOS on many older machines.)
-
-   You can use the device `(cd)' to access a CD-ROM in your config
-file. This is not required; GRUB automatically sets the root device to
-`(cd)' when booted from a CD-ROM. It is only necessary to refer to
-`(cd)' if you want to access other drives as well.

-4.1 How to boot operating systems
-=================================
-
-GRUB has two distinct boot methods. One of the two is to load an
-operating system directly, and the other is to chain-load another boot
-loader which then will load an operating system actually. Generally
-speaking, the former is more desirable, because you don't need to
-install or maintain other boot loaders and GRUB is flexible enough to
-load an operating system from an arbitrary disk/partition. However, the
-latter is sometimes required, since GRUB doesn't support all the
-existing operating systems natively.

-File: grub.info,  Node: Loading an operating system directly,  Next: Chain-loading,  Up: General boot methods
-
-4.1.1 How to boot an OS directly with GRUB
-------------------------------------------
-
-Multiboot (*note Multiboot Specification: (multiboot)Top.) is the
-native format supported by GRUB.  For the sake of convenience, there is
-also support for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. If you want to
-boot other operating systems, you will have to chain-load them (*note
-Chain-loading::).
-
-   Generally, GRUB can boot any Multiboot-compliant OS in the following
-steps:
-
-  1. Set GRUB's root device to the drive where the OS images are stored
-     with the command `root' (*note root::).
-
-  2. Load the kernel image with the command `kernel' (*note kernel::).
-
-  3. If you need modules, load them with the command `module' (*note
-     module::) or `modulenounzip' (*note modulenounzip::).
-
-  4. Run the command `boot' (*note boot::).
-
-   Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD can be booted in a similar
-manner. You load a kernel image with the command `kernel' and then run
-the command `boot'. If the kernel requires some parameters, just append
-the parameters to `kernel', after the file name of the kernel. Also,
-please refer to *Note OS-specific notes::, for information on your
-OS-specific issues.

-
-4.1.2 Load another boot loader to boot unsupported operating systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-If you want to boot an unsupported operating system (e.g. Windows 95),
-chain-load a boot loader for the operating system. Normally, the boot
-loader is embedded in the "boot sector" of the partition on which the
-operating system is installed.
-
-  1. Set GRUB's root device to the partition by the command
-     `rootnoverify' (*note rootnoverify::):
-
-          grub> rootnoverify (hd0,0)
-
-  2. Set the "active" flag in the partition using the command
-     `makeactive'(1) (*note Chain-loading-Footnote-1::) (*note
-     makeactive::):
-
-          grub> makeactive
-
-  3. Load the boot loader with the command `chainloader' (*note
-     chainloader::):
-
-          grub> chainloader +1
-
-     `+1' indicates that GRUB should read one sector from the start of
-     the partition. The complete description about this syntax can be
-     found in *Note Block list syntax::.
-
-  4. Run the command `boot' (*note boot::).
-
-   However, DOS and Windows have some deficiencies, so you might have to
-use more complicated instructions. *Note DOS/Windows::, for more
-information.

-4.2.1 GNU/Hurd
---------------
-
-Since GNU/Hurd is Multiboot-compliant, it is easy to boot it; there is
-nothing special about it. But do not forget that you have to specify a
-root partition to the kernel.
-
-  1. Set GRUB's root device to the same drive as GNU/Hurd's. Probably
-     the command `find /boot/gnumach' or similar can help you (*note
-     find::).
-
-  2. Load the kernel and the module, like this:
-
-          grub> kernel /boot/gnumach root=hd0s1
-          grub> module /boot/serverboot
-
-  3. Run the command `boot' (*note boot::).
-

-File: grub.info,  Node: GNU/Linux,  Next: FreeBSD,  Prev: GNU/Hurd,  Up: OS-specific notes
-
-4.2.2 GNU/Linux
----------------
-
-It is relatively easy to boot GNU/Linux from GRUB, because it somewhat
-resembles to boot a Multiboot-compliant OS.
-
-  1. Set GRUB's root device to the same drive as GNU/Linux's. Probably
-     the command `find /vmlinuz' or similar can help you (*note find::).
-
-  2. Load the kernel:
-
-          grub> kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
-
-     If you need to specify some kernel parameters, just append them to
-     the command. For example, to set `vga' to `ext', do this:
-
-          grub> kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1 vga=ext
-
-     See the documentation in the Linux source tree for complete
-     information on the available options.
-
-  3. If you use an initrd, execute the command `initrd' (*note
-     initrd::) after `kernel':
-
-          grub> initrd /initrd
-
-  4. Finally, run the command `boot' (*note boot::).
-
-   *Caution:* If you use an initrd and specify the `mem=' option to the
-kernel to let it use less than actual memory size, you will also have
-to specify the same memory size to GRUB. To let GRUB know the size, run
-the command `uppermem' _before_ loading the kernel. *Note uppermem::,
-for more information.

-
-4.2.3 FreeBSD
--------------
-
-GRUB can load the kernel directly, either in ELF or a.out format. But
-this is not recommended, since FreeBSD's bootstrap interface sometimes
-changes heavily, so GRUB can't guarantee to pass kernel parameters
-correctly.
-
-   Thus, we'd recommend loading the very flexible loader `/boot/loader'
-instead. See this example:
-
-     grub> root (hd0,a)
-     grub> kernel /boot/loader
-     grub> boot
-

-
-4.2.4 NetBSD
-------------
-
-GRUB can load NetBSD a.out and ELF directly, follow these steps:
-
-  1. Set GRUB's root device with `root' (*note root::).
-
-  2. Load the kernel with `kernel' (*note kernel::). You should append
-     the ugly option `--type=netbsd', if you want to load an ELF
-     kernel, like this:
-
-          grub> kernel --type=netbsd /netbsd-elf
-
-  3. Run `boot' (*note boot::).
-
-   For now, however, GRUB doesn't allow you to pass kernel parameters,
-so it may be better to chain-load it instead. For more information,
-please see *Note Chain-loading::.

-
-4.2.6 DOS/Windows
------------------
-
-GRUB cannot boot DOS or Windows directly, so you must chain-load them
-(*note Chain-loading::). However, their boot loaders have some critical
-deficiencies, so it may not work to just chain-load them. To overcome
-the problems, GRUB provides you with two helper functions.
-
-   If you have installed DOS (or Windows) on a non-first hard disk, you
-have to use the disk swapping technique, because that OS cannot boot
-from any disks but the first one. The workaround used in GRUB is the
-command `map' (*note map::), like this:
-
-     grub> map (hd0) (hd1)
-     grub> map (hd1) (hd0)
-
-   This performs a "virtual" swap between your first and second hard
-drive.
-
-   *Caution:* This is effective only if DOS (or Windows) uses BIOS to
-access the swapped disks. If that OS uses a special driver for the
-disks, this probably won't work.
-
-   Another problem arises if you installed more than one set of
-DOS/Windows onto one disk, because they could be confused if there are
-more than one primary partitions for DOS/Windows. Certainly you should
-avoid doing this, but there is a solution if you do want to do so. Use
-the partition hiding/unhiding technique.
-
-   If GRUB "hide"s a DOS (or Windows) partition (*note hide::), DOS (or
-Windows) will ignore the partition. If GRUB "unhide"s a DOS (or
-Windows) partition (*note unhide::), DOS (or Windows) will detect the
-partition. Thus, if you have installed DOS (or Windows) on the first
-and the second partition of the first hard disk, and you want to boot
-the copy on the first partition, do the following:
-
-     grub> unhide (hd0,0)
-     grub> hide (hd0,1)
-     grub> rootnoverify (hd0,0)
-     grub> chainloader +1
-     grub> makeactive

-------------------
-
-It is known that the signature in the boot loader for SCO UnixWare is
-wrong, so you will have to specify the option `--force' to
-`chainloader' (*note chainloader::), like this:
-
-     grub> rootnoverify (hd1,0)

-4.3 How to make your system robust
-==================================
-
-When you test a new kernel or a new OS, it is important to make sure
-that your computer can boot even if the new system is unbootable. This
-is crucial especially if you maintain servers or remote systems. To
-accomplish this goal, you need to set up two things:
-
-  1. You must maintain a system which is always bootable. For instance,
-     if you test a new kernel, you need to keep a working kernel in a
-     different place. And, it would sometimes be very nice to even have
-     a complete copy of a working system in a different partition or
-     disk.
-
-  2. You must direct GRUB to boot a working system when the new system
-     fails. This is possible with the "fallback" system in GRUB.
-
-   The former requirement is very specific to each OS, so this
-documentation does not cover that topic. It is better to consult some
-backup tools.
-
-   So let's see the GRUB part. There are two possibilities: one of them
-is quite simple but not very robust, and the other is a bit complex to
-set up but probably the best solution to make sure that your system can
-start as long as GRUB itself is bootable.
-
-* Menu:
-
-* Booting once-only::
-* Booting fallback systems::
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Booting once-only,  Next: Booting fallback systems,  Up: Making your system robust
-
-4.3.1 Booting once-only
------------------------
-
-You can teach GRUB to boot an entry only at next boot time. Suppose
-that your have an old kernel `old_kernel' and a new kernel
-`new_kernel'. You know that `old_kernel' can boot your system
-correctly, and you want to test `new_kernel'.
-
-   To ensure that your system will go back to the old kernel even if the
-new kernel fails (e.g. it panics), you can specify that GRUB should try
-the new kernel only once and boot the old kernel after that.
-
-   First, modify your configuration file. Here is an example:
-
-     default saved        # This is important!!!
-     timeout 10
-
-     title the old kernel
-     root (hd0,0)
-     kernel /old_kernel
-     savedefault
-
-     title the new kernel
-     root (hd0,0)
-     kernel /new_kernel
-     savedefault 0         # This is important!!!
-
-   Note that this configuration file uses `default saved' (*note
-default::) at the head and `savedefault 0' (*note savedefault::) in the
-entry for the new kernel. This means that GRUB boots a saved entry by
-default, and booting the entry for the new kernel saves `0' as the
-saved entry.
-
-   With this configuration file, after all, GRUB always tries to boot
-the old kernel after it booted the new one, because `0' is the entry of
-`the old kernel'.
-
-   The next step is to tell GRUB to boot the new kernel at next boot
-time. For this, execute `grub-set-default' (*note Invoking
-grub-set-default::):
-
-     # grub-set-default 1
-
-   This command sets the saved entry to `1', that is, to the new kernel.
-
-   This method is useful, but still not very robust, because GRUB stops
-booting, if there is any error in the boot entry, such that the new
-kernel has an invalid executable format. Thus, it it even better to use
-the "fallback" mechanism of GRUB. Look at next subsection for this
-feature.
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Booting fallback systems,  Prev: Booting once-only,  Up: Making your system robust
-
-4.3.2 Booting fallback systems
-------------------------------
-
-GRUB supports a fallback mechanism of booting one or more other entries
-if a default boot entry fails. You can specify multiple fallback
-entries if you wish.
-
-   Suppose that you have three systems, `A', `B' and `C'. `A' is a
-system which you want to boot by default. `B' is a backup system which
-is supposed to boot safely. `C' is another backup system which is used
-in case where `B' is broken.
-
-   Then you may want GRUB to boot the first system which is bootable
-among `A', `B' and `C'. A configuration file can be written in this way:
-
-     default saved        # This is important!!!
-     timeout 10
-     fallback 1 2         # This is important!!!
-
-     title A
-     root (hd0,0)
-     kernel /kernel
-     savedefault fallback # This is important!!!
-
-     title B
-     root (hd1,0)
-     kernel /kernel
-     savedefault fallback # This is important!!!
-
-     title C
-     root (hd2,0)
-     kernel /kernel
-     savedefault
-
-   Note that `default saved' (*note default::), `fallback 1 2' and
-`savedefault fallback' are used. GRUB will boot a saved entry by
-default and save a fallback entry as next boot entry with this
-configuration.
-
-   When GRUB tries to boot `A', GRUB saves `1' as next boot entry,
-because the command `fallback' specifies that `1' is the first fallback
-entry. The entry `1' is `B', so GRUB will try to boot `B' at next boot
-time.
-
-   Likewise, when GRUB tries to boot `B', GRUB saves `2' as next boot
-entry, because `fallback' specifies `2' as next fallback entry. This
-makes sure that GRUB will boot `C' after booting `B'.
-
-   It is noteworthy that GRUB uses fallback entries both when GRUB
-itself fails in booting an entry and when `A' or `B' fails in starting
-up your system. So this solution ensures that your system is started
-even if GRUB cannot find your kernel or if your kernel panics.
-
-   However, you need to run `grub-set-default' (*note Invoking
-grub-set-default::) when `A' starts correctly or you fix `A' after it
-crashes, since GRUB always sets next boot entry to a fallback entry.
-You should run this command in a startup script such as `rc.local' to
-boot `A' by default:
-
-     # grub-set-default 0
-
-   where `0' is the number of the boot entry for the system `A'.
-
-   If you want to see what is current default entry, you can look at the
-file `/boot/grub/default' (or `/grub/default' in some systems). Because
-this file is plain-text, you can just `cat' this file. But it is
-strongly recommended *not to modify this file directly*, because GRUB
-may fail in saving a default entry in this file, if you change this
-file in an unintended manner. Therefore, you should use
-`grub-set-default' when you need to change the default entry.

-5 Configuration
-***************
-
-You've probably noticed that you need to type several commands to boot
-your OS. There's a solution to that - GRUB provides a menu interface
-(*note Menu interface::) from which you can select an item (using arrow
-keys) that will do everything to boot an OS.
-
-   To enable the menu, you need a configuration file, `menu.lst' under
-the boot directory. We'll analyze an example file.
-
-   The file first contains some general settings, the menu interface
-related options. You can put these commands (*note Menu-specific
-commands::) before any of the items (starting with `title' (*note
-title::)).
-
-     #
-     # Sample boot menu configuration file
-     #
-
-   As you may have guessed, these lines are comments. Lines starting
-with a hash character (`#'), and blank lines, are ignored by GRUB.
-
-     # By default, boot the first entry.
-     default 0
-
-   The first entry (here, counting starts with number zero, not one!)
-will be the default choice.
-
-     # Boot automatically after 30 secs.
-     timeout 30
-
-   As the comment says, GRUB will boot automatically in 30 seconds,
-unless interrupted with a keypress.
-
-     # Fallback to the second entry.
-     fallback 1
-
-   If, for any reason, the default entry doesn't work, fall back to the
-second one (this is rarely used, for obvious reasons).
-
-   Note that the complete descriptions of these commands, which are menu
-interface specific, can be found in *Note Menu-specific commands::.
-Other descriptions can be found in *Note Commands::.
-
-   Now, on to the actual OS definitions. You will see that each entry
-begins with a special command, `title' (*note title::), and the action
-is described after it. Note that there is no command `boot' (*note
-boot::) at the  end of each item. That is because GRUB automatically
-executes `boot' if it loads other commands successfully.
-
-   The argument for the command `title' is used to display a short
-title/description of the entry in the menu. Since `title' displays the
-argument as is, you can write basically anything there.
-
-     # For booting GNU/Hurd
-     title  GNU/Hurd
-     root   (hd0,0)
-     kernel /boot/gnumach.gz root=hd0s1
-     module /boot/serverboot.gz
-
-   This boots GNU/Hurd from the first hard disk.
-
-     # For booting GNU/Linux
-     title  GNU/Linux
-     kernel (hd1,0)/vmlinuz root=/dev/hdb1
-
-   This boots GNU/Linux, but from the second hard disk.
-
-     # For booting Mach (getting kernel from floppy)
-     title  Utah Mach4 multiboot
-     root   (hd0,2)
-     pause  Insert the diskette now^G!!
-     kernel (fd0)/boot/kernel root=hd0s3
-     module (fd0)/boot/bootstrap
-
-   This boots Mach with a kernel on a floppy, but the root filesystem at
-hd0s3. It also contains a `pause' line (*note pause::), which will
-cause GRUB to display a prompt and delay, before actually executing the
-rest of the commands and booting.
-
-     # For booting FreeBSD
-     title  FreeBSD
-     root   (hd0,2,a)
-     kernel /boot/loader
-
-   This item will boot FreeBSD kernel loaded from the `a' partition of
-the third PC slice of the first hard disk.
-
-     # For booting OS/2
-     title OS/2
-     root  (hd0,1)
-     makeactive
-     # chainload OS/2 bootloader from the first sector
-     chainloader +1
-     # This is similar to "chainload", but loads a specific file
-     #chainloader /boot/chain.os2
-
-   This will boot OS/2, using a chain-loader (*note Chain-loading::).
-
-     # For booting Windows NT or Windows95
-     title Windows NT / Windows 95 boot menu
-     root        (hd0,0)
-     makeactive
-     chainloader +1
-     # For loading DOS if Windows NT is installed
-     # chainload /bootsect.dos
-
-   The same as the above, but for Windows.
-
-     # For installing GRUB into the hard disk
-     title Install GRUB into the hard disk
-     root    (hd0,0)
-     setup   (hd0)
-
-   This will just (re)install GRUB onto the hard disk.
-
-     # Change the colors.
-     title Change the colors
-     color light-green/brown blink-red/blue
-
-   In the last entry, the command `color' is used (*note color::), to
-change the menu colors (try it!). This command is somewhat special,
-because it can be used both in the command-line and in the menu. GRUB
-has several such commands, see *Note General commands::.
-
-   We hope that you now understand how to use the basic features of
-GRUB. To learn more about GRUB, see the following chapters.

-6 Downloading OS images from a network
-**************************************
-
-Although GRUB is a disk-based boot loader, it does provide network
-support. To use the network support, you need to enable at least one
-network driver in the GRUB build process. For more information please
-see `netboot/README.netboot' in the source distribution.

-6.1 How to set up your network
-==============================
-
-GRUB requires a file server and optionally a server that will assign an
-IP address to the machine on which GRUB is running. For the former, only
-TFTP is supported at the moment. The latter is either BOOTP, DHCP or a
-RARP server(1) (*note General usage of network support-Footnote-1::).
-It is not necessary to run both the servers on one computer. How to
-configure these servers is beyond the scope of this document, so please
-refer to the manuals specific to those protocols/servers.
-
-   If you decided to use a server to assign an IP address, set up the
-server and run `bootp' (*note bootp::), `dhcp' (*note dhcp::) or `rarp'
-(*note rarp::) for BOOTP, DHCP or RARP, respectively. Each command will
-show an assigned IP address, a netmask, an IP address for your TFTP
-server and a gateway. If any of the addresses is wrong or it causes an
-error, probably the configuration of your servers isn't set up properly.
-
-   Otherwise, run `ifconfig', like this:
-
-     grub> ifconfig --address=192.168.110.23 --server=192.168.110.14
-
-   You can also use `ifconfig' in conjuction with `bootp', `dhcp' or
-`rarp' (e.g. to reassign the server address manually). *Note
-ifconfig::, for more details.
-
-   Finally, download your OS images from your network. The network can
-be accessed using the network drive `(nd)'. Everything else is very
-similar to the normal instructions (*note Booting::).
-
-   Here is an example:
-
-     grub> bootp
-     Probing... [NE*000]
-     NE2000 base ...
-     Address: 192.168.110.23    Netmask: 255.255.255.0
-     Server: 192.168.110.14     Gateway: 192.168.110.1
-
-     grub> root (nd)
-     grub> kernel /tftproot/gnumach.gz root=sd0s1
-     grub> module /tftproot/serverboot.gz
-     grub> boot

-6.2 Booting from a network
-==========================
-
-It is sometimes very useful to boot from a network, especially when you
-use a machine which has no local disk. In this case, you need to obtain
-a kind of Net Boot ROM, such as a PXE ROM or a free software package
-like Etherboot. Such a Boot ROM first boots the machine, sets up the
-network card installed into the machine, and downloads a second stage
-boot image from the network. Then, the second image will try to boot an
-operating system actually from the network.
-
-   GRUB provides two second stage images, `nbgrub' and `pxegrub' (*note
-Images::). These images are the same as the normal Stage 2, except that
-they set up a network automatically, and try to load a configuration
-file from the network, if specified. The usage is very simple: If the
-machine has a PXE ROM, use `pxegrub'. If the machine has an NBI loader
-such as Etherboot, use `nbgrub'. There is no difference between them
-except their formats. Since the way to load a second stage image you
-want to use should be described in the manual on your Net Boot ROM,
-please refer to the manual, for more information.
-
-   However, there is one thing specific to GRUB. Namely, how to specify
-a configuration file in a BOOTP/DHCP server. For now, GRUB uses the tag
-`150', to get the name of a configuration file. The following is an
-example with a BOOTP configuration:
-
-     .allhost:hd=/tmp:bf=null:\
-             :ds=145.71.35.1 145.71.32.1:\
-             :sm=255.255.254.0:\
-             :gw=145.71.35.1:\
-             :sa=145.71.35.5:
-
-     foo:ht=1:ha=63655d0334a7:ip=145.71.35.127:\
-             :bf=/nbgrub:\
-             :tc=.allhost:\
-             :T150="(nd)/tftpboot/menu.lst.foo":
-
-   Note that you should specify the drive name `(nd)' in the name of
-the configuration file. This is because you might change the root drive
-before downloading the configuration from the TFTP server when the
-preset menu feature is used (*note Preset Menu::).
-
-   See the manual of your BOOTP/DHCP server for more information. The
-exact syntax should differ a little from the example.

-
-7 Using GRUB via a serial line
-******************************
-
-This chapter describes how to use the serial terminal support in GRUB.
-
-   If you have many computers or computers with no display/keyboard, it
-could be very useful to control the computers through serial
-communications. To connect one computer with another via a serial line,
-you need to prepare a null-modem (cross) serial cable, and you may need
-to have multiport serial boards, if your computer doesn't have extra
-serial ports. In addition, a terminal emulator is also required, such as
-minicom. Refer to a manual of your operating system, for more
-information.
-
-   As for GRUB, the instruction to set up a serial terminal is quite
-simple. First of all, make sure that you haven't specified the option
-`--disable-serial' to the configure script when you built your GRUB
-images. If you get them in binary form, probably they have serial
-terminal support already.
-
-   Then, initialize your serial terminal after GRUB starts up. Here is
-an example:
-
-     grub> serial --unit=0 --speed=9600
-     grub> terminal serial
-
-   The command `serial' initializes the serial unit 0 with the speed
-9600bps. The serial unit 0 is usually called `COM1', so, if you want to
-use COM2, you must specify `--unit=1' instead. This command accepts
-many other options, so please refer to *Note serial::, for more details.
-
-   The command `terminal' (*note terminal::) chooses which type of
-terminal you want to use. In the case above, the terminal will be a
-serial terminal, but you can also pass `console' to the command, as
-`terminal serial console'. In this case, a terminal in which you press
-any key will be selected as a GRUB terminal.
-
-   However, note that GRUB assumes that your terminal emulator is
-compatible with VT100 by default. This is true for most terminal
-emulators nowadays, but you should pass the option `--dumb' to the
-command if your terminal emulator is not VT100-compatible or implements
-few VT100 escape sequences. If you specify this option then GRUB
-provides you with an alternative menu interface, because the normal
-menu requires several fancy features of your terminal.

-
-8 Embedding a configuration file into GRUB
-******************************************
-
-GRUB supports a "preset menu" which is to be always loaded before
-starting. The preset menu feature is useful, for example, when your
-computer has no console but a serial cable. In this case, it is
-critical to set up the serial terminal as soon as possible, since you
-cannot see any message until the serial terminal begins to work. So it
-is good to run the commands `serial' (*note serial::) and `terminal'
-(*note terminal::) before anything else at the start-up time.
-
-   How the preset menu works is slightly complicated:
-
-  1. GRUB checks if the preset menu feature is used, and loads the
-     preset menu, if available. This includes running commands and
-     reading boot entries, like an ordinary configuration file.
-
-  2. GRUB checks if the configuration file is available. Note that this
-     check is performed *regardless of the existence of the preset
-     menu*. The configuration file is loaded even if the preset menu was
-     loaded.
-
-  3. If the preset menu includes any boot entries, they are cleared when
-     the configuration file is loaded. It doesn't matter whether the
-     configuration file has any entries or no entry. The boot entries
-     in the preset menu are used only when GRUB fails in loading the
-     configuration file.
-
-   To enable the preset menu feature, you must rebuild GRUB specifying a
-file to the configure script with the option `--enable-preset-menu'.
-The file has the same semantics as normal configuration files (*note
-Configuration::).
-
-   Another point you should take care is that the diskless support
-(*note Diskless::) diverts the preset menu. Diskless images embed a
-preset menu to execute the command `bootp' (*note bootp::)
-automatically, unless you specify your own preset menu to the configure
-script. This means that you must put commands to initialize a network in
-the preset menu yourself, because diskless images don't set it up
-implicitly, when you use the preset menu explicitly.
-
-   Therefore, a typical preset menu used with diskless support would be
-like this:
-
-     # Set up the serial terminal, first of all.
-     serial --unit=0 --speed=19200
-     terminal --timeout=0 serial
-
-     # Initialize the network.
-     dhcp

-9 Protecting your computer from cracking
-****************************************
-
-You may be interested in how to prevent ordinary users from doing
-whatever they like, if you share your computer with other people. So
-this chapter describes how to improve the security of GRUB.
-
-   One thing which could be a security hole is that the user can do too
-many things with GRUB, because GRUB allows one to modify its
-configuration and run arbitrary commands at run-time. For example, the
-user can even read `/etc/passwd' in the command-line interface by the
-command `cat' (*note cat::). So it is necessary to disable all the
-interactive operations.
-
-   Thus, GRUB provides a "password" feature, so that only administrators
-can start the interactive operations (i.e. editing menu entries and
-entering the command-line interface). To use this feature, you need to
-run the command `password' in your configuration file (*note
-password::), like this:
-
-     password --md5 PASSWORD
-
-   If this is specified, GRUB disallows any interactive control, until
-you press the key <p> and enter a correct password.  The option `--md5'
-tells GRUB that `PASSWORD' is in MD5 format.  If it is omitted, GRUB
-assumes the `PASSWORD' is in clear text.
-
-   You can encrypt your password with the command `md5crypt' (*note
-md5crypt::). For example, run the grub shell (*note Invoking the grub
-shell::), and enter your password:
-
-     grub> md5crypt
-     Password: **********
-     Encrypted: $1$U$JK7xFegdxWH6VuppCUSIb.
-
-   Then, cut and paste the encrypted password to your configuration
-file.
-
-   Also, you can specify an optional argument to `password'. See this
-example:
-
-     password PASSWORD /boot/grub/menu-admin.lst
-
-   In this case, GRUB will load `/boot/grub/menu-admin.lst' as a
-configuration file when you enter the valid password.
-
-   Another thing which may be dangerous is that any user can choose any
-menu entry. Usually, this wouldn't be problematic, but you might want to
-permit only administrators to run some of your menu entries, such as an
-entry for booting an insecure OS like DOS.
-
-   GRUB provides the command `lock' (*note lock::). This command always
-fails until you enter the valid password, so you can use it, like this:
-
-     title Boot DOS
-     lock
-     rootnoverify (hd0,1)
-     makeactive
-     chainload +1
-
-   You should insert `lock' right after `title', because any user can
-execute commands in an entry until GRUB encounters `lock'.
-
-   You can also use the command `password' instead of `lock'. In this
-case the boot process will ask for the password and stop if it was
-entered incorrectly.  Since the `password' takes its own PASSWORD
-argument this is useful if you want different passwords for different
-entries.

-10 GRUB image files
-*******************
-
-GRUB consists of several images: two essential stages, optional stages
-called "Stage 1.5", one image for bootable CD-ROM, and two network boot
-images. Here is a short overview of them. *Note Internals::, for more
-details.
-
-`stage1'
-     This is an essential image used for booting up GRUB. Usually, this
-     is embedded in an MBR or the boot sector of a partition. Because a
-     PC boot sector is 512 bytes, the size of this image is exactly 512
-     bytes.
-
-     All `stage1' must do is to load Stage 2 or Stage 1.5 from a local
-     disk. Because of the size restriction, `stage1' encodes the
-     location of Stage 2 (or Stage 1.5) in a block list format, so it
-     never understand any filesystem structure.
-
-`stage2'
-     This is the core image of GRUB. It does everything but booting up
-     itself. Usually, this is put in a filesystem, but that is not
-     required.
-
-`e2fs_stage1_5'
-`fat_stage1_5'
-`ffs_stage1_5'
-`jfs_stage1_5'
-`minix_stage1_5'
-`reiserfs_stage1_5'
-`vstafs_stage1_5'
-`xfs_stage1_5'
-     These are called "Stage 1.5", because they serve as a bridge
-     between `stage1' and `stage2', that is to say, Stage 1.5 is loaded
-     by Stage 1 and Stage 1.5 loads Stage 2. The difference between
-     `stage1' and `*_stage1_5' is that the former doesn't understand
-     any filesystem while the latter understands one filesystem (e.g.
-     `e2fs_stage1_5' understands ext2fs). So you can move the Stage 2
-     image to another location safely, even after GRUB has been
-     installed.
-
-     While Stage 2 cannot generally be embedded in a fixed area as the
-     size is so large, Stage 1.5 can be installed into the area right
-     after an MBR, or the boot loader area of a ReiserFS or a FFS.
-
-`stage2_eltorito'
-     This is a boot image for CD-ROMs using the "no emulation mode" in
-     El Torito specification. This is identical to Stage 2, except that
-     this boots up without Stage 1 and sets up a special drive `(cd)'.
-
-`nbgrub'
-     This is a network boot image for the Network Image Proposal used
-     by some network boot loaders, such as Etherboot. This is mostly
-     the same as Stage 2, but it also sets up a network and loads a
-     configuration file from the network.
-
-`pxegrub'
-     This is another network boot image for the Preboot Execution
-     Environment used by several Netboot ROMs. This is identical to
-     `nbgrub', except for the format.

-11 Filesystem syntax and semantics
-**********************************
-
-GRUB uses a special syntax for specifying disk drives which can be
-accessed by BIOS. Because of BIOS limitations, GRUB cannot distinguish
-between IDE, ESDI, SCSI, or others. You must know yourself which BIOS
-device is equivalent to which OS device. Normally, that will be clear if
-you see the files in a device or use the command `find' (*note find::).

-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Device syntax,  Next: File name syntax,  Up: Filesystem
-
-11.1 How to specify devices
-===========================
-
-The device syntax is like this:
-
-     `(DEVICE[,PART-NUM][,BSD-SUBPART-LETTER])'
-
-   `[]' means the parameter is optional. DEVICE should be either `fd'
-or `hd' followed by a digit, like `fd0'.  But you can also set DEVICE
-to a hexadecimal or a decimal number which is a BIOS drive number, so
-the following are equivalent:
-
-     (hd0)
-     (0x80)
-     (128)
-
-   PART-NUM represents the partition number of DEVICE, starting from
-zero for primary partitions and from four for extended partitions, and
-BSD-SUBPART-LETTER represents the BSD disklabel subpartition, such as
-`a' or `e'.
-
-   A shortcut for specifying BSD subpartitions is
-`(DEVICE,BSD-SUBPART-LETTER)', in this case, GRUB searches for the
-first PC partition containing a BSD disklabel, then finds the
-subpartition BSD-SUBPART-LETTER. Here is an example:
-
-     (hd0,a)
-
-   The syntax `(hd0)' represents using the entire disk (or the MBR when
-installing GRUB), while the syntax `(hd0,0)' represents using the first
-partition of the disk (or the boot sector of the partition when
-installing GRUB).
-
-   If you enabled the network support, the special drive, `(nd)', is
-also available. Before using the network drive, you must initialize the
-network. *Note Network::, for more information.
-
-   If you boot GRUB from a CD-ROM, `(cd)' is available. *Note Making a
-GRUB bootable CD-ROM::, for details.

-11.2 How to specify files
-=========================
-
-There are two ways to specify files, by "absolute file name" and by
-"block list".
-
-   An absolute file name resembles a Unix absolute file name, using `/'
-for the directory separator (not `\' as in DOS). One example is
-`(hd0,0)/boot/grub/menu.lst'. This means the file `/boot/grub/menu.lst'
-in the first partition of the first hard disk. If you omit the device
-name in an absolute file name, GRUB uses GRUB's "root device"
-implicitly. So if you set the root device to, say, `(hd1,0)' by the
-command `root' (*note root::), then `/boot/kernel' is the same as
-`(hd1,0)/boot/kernel'.

-11.3 How to specify block lists
-===============================
-
-A block list is used for specifying a file that doesn't appear in the
-filesystem, like a chainloader. The syntax is
-`[OFFSET]+LENGTH[,[OFFSET]+LENGTH]...'.  Here is an example:
-
-     `0+100,200+1,300+300'
-
-   This represents that GRUB should read blocks 0 through 99, block 200,
-and blocks 300 through 599. If you omit an offset, then GRUB assumes
-the offset is zero.
-
-   Like the file name syntax (*note File name syntax::), if a blocklist
-does not contain a device name, then GRUB uses GRUB's "root device". So
-`(hd0,1)+1' is the same as `+1' when the root device is `(hd0,1)'.

-12 GRUB's user interface
-************************
-
-GRUB has both a simple menu interface for choosing preset entries from a
-configuration file, and a highly flexible command-line for performing
-any desired combination of boot commands.
-
-   GRUB looks for its configuration file as soon as it is loaded. If one
-is found, then the full menu interface is activated using whatever
-entries were found in the file. If you choose the "command-line" menu
-option, or if the configuration file was not found, then GRUB drops to
-the command-line interface.
-
-* Menu:

-* Command-line interface::      The flexible command-line interface
-* Menu interface::              The simple menu interface
-* Menu entry editor::           Editing a menu entry
-* Hidden menu interface::       The hidden menu interface

-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Command-line interface,  Next: Menu interface,  Up: Interface
-
-12.1 The flexible command-line interface
-========================================
-
-The command-line interface provides a prompt and after it an editable
-text area much like a command-line in Unix or DOS. Each command is
-immediately executed after it is entered(1) (*note Command-line
-interface-Footnote-1::). The commands (*note Command-line and menu
-entry commands::) are a subset of those available in the configuration
-file, used with exactly the same syntax.
-
-   Cursor movement and editing of the text on the line can be done via a
-subset of the functions available in the Bash shell:
-
-<C-f>
-<PC right key>
-     Move forward one character.
-
-<C-b>
-<PC left key>
-     Move back one character.
-
-<C-a>
-<HOME>
-     Move to the start of the line.
-
-<C-e>
-<END>
-     Move the the end of the line.
-
-<C-d>
-<DEL>
-     Delete the character underneath the cursor.
-
-<C-h>
-<BS>
-     Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
-
-<C-k>
-     Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the
-     line.
-
-<C-u>
-     Kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
-
-<C-y>
-     Yank the killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.
-
-<C-p>
-<PC up key>
-     Move up through the history list.
-
-<C-n>
-<PC down key>
-     Move down through the history list.
-
-   When typing commands interactively, if the cursor is within or before
-the first word in the command-line, pressing the <TAB> key (or <C-i>)
-will display a listing of the available commands, and if the cursor is
-after the first word, the `<TAB>' will provide a completion listing of
-disks, partitions, and file names depending on the context. Note that
-to obtain a list of drives, one must open a parenthesis, as `root ('.
-
-   Note that you cannot use the completion functionality in the TFTP
-filesystem. This is because TFTP doesn't support file name listing for
-the security.

-
-12.2 The simple menu interface
-==============================
-
-The menu interface is quite easy to use. Its commands are both
-reasonably intuitive and described on screen.
-
-   Basically, the menu interface provides a list of "boot entries" to
-the user to choose from. Use the arrow keys to select the entry of
-choice, then press <RET> to run it.  An optional timeout is available
-to boot the default entry (the first one if not set), which is aborted
-by pressing any key.
-
-   Commands are available to enter a bare command-line by pressing <c>
-(which operates exactly like the non-config-file version of GRUB, but
-allows one to return to the menu if desired by pressing <ESC>) or to
-edit any of the "boot entries" by pressing <e>.
-
-   If you protect the menu interface with a password (*note Security::),
-all you can do is choose an entry by pressing <RET>, or press <p> to
-enter the password.
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Menu entry editor,  Next: Hidden menu interface,  Prev: Menu interface,  Up: Interface
-
-12.3 Editing a menu entry
-=========================
-
-The menu entry editor looks much like the main menu interface, but the
-lines in the menu are individual commands in the selected entry instead
-of entry names.
-
-   If an <ESC> is pressed in the editor, it aborts all the changes made
-to the configuration entry and returns to the main menu interface.
-
-   When a particular line is selected, the editor places the user in a
-special version of the GRUB command-line to edit that line.  When the
-user hits <RET>, GRUB replaces the line in question in the boot entry
-with the changes (unless it was aborted via <ESC>, in which case the
-changes are thrown away).
-
-   If you want to add a new line to the menu entry, press <o> if adding
-a line after the current line or press <O> if before the current line.
-
-   To delete a line, hit the key <d>. Although GRUB unfortunately does
-not support "undo", you can do almost the same thing by just returning
-to the main menu.
-

-File: grub.info,  Node: Hidden menu interface,  Prev: Menu entry editor,  Up: Interface
-
-12.4 The hidden menu interface
-==============================
-
-When your terminal is dumb or you request GRUB to hide the menu
-interface explicitly with the command `hiddenmenu' (*note
-hiddenmenu::), GRUB doesn't show the menu interface (*note Menu
-interface::) and automatically boots the default entry, unless
-interrupted by pressing <ESC>.
-
-   When you interrupt the timeout and your terminal is dumb, GRUB falls
-back to the command-line interface (*note Command-line interface::).

-13 The list of available commands
-*********************************
-
-In this chapter, we list all commands that are available in GRUB.
-
-   Commands belong to different groups. A few can only be used in the
-global section of the configuration file (or "menu"); most of them can
-be entered on the command-line and can be used either anywhere in the
-menu or specifically in the menu entries.
-
-* Menu:
-
-* Menu-specific commands::
-* General commands::
-* Command-line and menu entry commands::
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Menu-specific commands,  Next: General commands,  Up: Commands
-
-13.1 The list of commands for the menu only
-===========================================
-
-The semantics used in parsing the configuration file are the following:
-
-   * The menu-specific commands have to be used before any others.
-
-   * The files _must_ be in plain-text format.
-
-   * `#' at the beginning of a line in a configuration file means it is
-     only a comment.
-
-   * Options are separated by spaces.
-
-   * All numbers can be either decimal or hexadecimal. A hexadecimal
-     number must be preceded by `0x', and is case-insensitive.
-
-   * Extra options or text at the end of the line are ignored unless
-     otherwise specified.
-
-   * Unrecognized commands are added to the current entry, except
-     before entries start, where they are ignored.
-
-   These commands can only be used in the menu:
-
-* Menu:
-
-* default::                     Set the default entry
-* fallback::                    Set the fallback entry
-* hiddenmenu::                  Hide the menu interface
-* timeout::                     Set the timeout
-* title::                       Start a menu entry
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: default,  Next: fallback,  Up: Menu-specific commands
-
-13.1.1 default
---------------
-
- -- Command: default num
-     Set the default entry to the entry number NUM. Numbering starts
-     from 0, and the entry number 0 is the default if the command is not
-     used.
-
-     You can specify `saved' instead of a number. In this case, the
-     default entry is the entry saved with the command `savedefault'.
-     *Note savedefault::, for more information.

-
-13.1.2 fallback
----------------
-
- -- Command: fallback num...
-     Go into unattended boot mode: if the default boot entry has any
-     errors, instead of waiting for the user to do something,
-     immediately start over using the NUM entry (same numbering as the
-     `default' command (*note default::)). This obviously won't help if
-     the machine was rebooted by a kernel that GRUB loaded. You can
-     specify multiple fallback entry numbers.

-13.1.3 hiddenmenu
------------------
-
- -- Command: hiddenmenu
-     Don't display the menu. If the command is used, no menu will be
-     displayed on the control terminal, and the default entry will be
-     booted after the timeout expired. The user can still request the
-     menu to be displayed by pressing <ESC> before the timeout expires.

-13.2.1 bootp
-------------
-
- -- Command: bootp [`--with-configfile']
-     Initialize a network device via the "BOOTP" protocol. This command
-     is only available if GRUB is compiled with netboot support. See
-     also *Note Network::.
-
-     If you specify `--with-configfile' to this command, GRUB will
-     fetch and load a configuration file specified by your BOOTP server
-     with the vendor tag `150'.

-
-13.2.2 color
-------------
-
- -- Command: color normal [highlight]
-     Change the menu colors. The color NORMAL is used for most lines in
-     the menu (*note Menu interface::), and the color HIGHLIGHT is used
-     to highlight the line where the cursor points. If you omit
-     HIGHLIGHT, then the inverted color of NORMAL is used for the
-     highlighted line. The format of a color is
-     `FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND'. FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND are symbolic
-     color names. A symbolic color name must be one of these:
-
-        * black
-
-        * blue
-
-        * green
-
-        * cyan
-
-        * red
-
-        * magenta
-
-        * brown
-
-        * light-gray
-
-          *These below can be specified only for the foreground.*
-
-        * dark-gray
-
-        * light-blue
-
-        * light-green
-
-        * light-cyan

-
-        * light-magenta
-
-        * yellow
-
-        * white
-
-     But only the first eight names can be used for BACKGROUND. You can
-     prefix `blink-' to FOREGROUND if you want a blinking foreground
-     color.
-
-     This command can be used in the configuration file and on the
-     command line, so you may write something like this in your
-     configuration file:
-
-          # Set default colors.
-          color light-gray/blue black/light-gray
-
-          # Change the colors.

-13.2.3 device
--------------
-
- -- Command: device drive file
-     In the grub shell, specify the file FILE as the actual drive for a
-     BIOS drive DRIVE. You can use this command to create a disk image,
-     and/or to fix the drives guessed by GRUB when GRUB fails to
-     determine them correctly, like this:
-
-          grub> device (fd0) /floppy-image
-          grub> device (hd0) /dev/sd0

-13.2.4 dhcp
------------
-
- -- Command: dhcp [-with-configfile]
-     Initialize a network device via the "DHCP" protocol. Currently,
-     this command is just an alias for `bootp', since the two protocols
-     are very similar. This command is only available if GRUB is
-     compiled with netboot support. See also *Note Network::.
-
-     If you specify `--with-configfile' to this command, GRUB will
-     fetch and load a configuration file specified by your DHCP server
-     with the vendor tag `150'.

-13.2.5 hide
------------
-
- -- Command: hide partition
-     Hide the partition PARTITION by setting the "hidden" bit in its
-     partition type code. This is useful only when booting DOS or
-     Windows and multiple primary FAT partitions exist in one disk. See
-     also *Note DOS/Windows::.

-          [`--mask=mask'] [`--address=address']
-     Configure the IP address, the netmask, the gateway, and the server
-     address of a network device manually. The values must be in dotted
-     decimal format, like `192.168.11.178'. The order of the options is
-     not important. This command shows current network configuration,

---------------
-
- -- Command: partnew part type from len
-     Create a new primary partition. PART is a partition specification
-     in GRUB syntax (*note Naming convention::); TYPE is the partition
-     type and must be a number in the range `0-0xff'; FROM is the
-     starting address and LEN is the length, both in sector units.

-     If used in the first section of a menu file, disable all
-     interactive editing control (menu entry editor and command-line)
-     and entries protected by the command `lock'. If the password
-     PASSWD is entered, it loads the NEW-CONFIG-FILE as a new config
-     file and restarts the GRUB Stage 2, if NEW-CONFIG-FILE is
-     specified. Otherwise, GRUB will just unlock the privileged
-     instructions.  You can also use this command in the script
-     section, in which case it will ask for the password, before
-     continuing.  The option `--md5' tells GRUB that PASSWD is
-     encrypted with `md5crypt' (*note md5crypt::).

-          [`--word=word'] [`--parity=parity'] [`--stop=stop']
-          [`--device=dev']
-     Initialize a serial device. UNIT is a number in the range 0-3
-     specifying which serial port to use; default is 0, which
-     corresponds to the port often called COM1. PORT is the I/O port
-     where the UART is to be found; if specified it takes precedence
-     over UNIT.  SPEED is the transmission speed; default is 9600. WORD
-     and STOP are the number of data bits and stop bits. Data bits must
-     be in the range 5-8 and stop bits must be 1 or 2. Default is 8 data
-     bits and one stop bit. PARITY is one of `no', `odd', `even' and
-     defaults to `no'. The option `--device' can only be used in the
-     grub shell and is used to specify the tty device to be used in the
-     host operating system (*note Invoking the grub shell::).
-
-     The serial port is not used as a communication channel unless the
-     `terminal' command is used (*note terminal::).
-
-     This command is only available if GRUB is compiled with serial
-     support. See also *Note Serial terminal::.

---------------
-
- -- Command: setkey [to_key from_key]
-     Change the keyboard map. The key FROM_KEY is mapped to the key
-     TO_KEY. If no argument is specified, reset key mappings. Note that
-     this command _does not_ exchange the keys. If you want to exchange
-     the keys, run this command again with the arguments exchanged,
-     like this:
-
-          grub> setkey capslock control
-          grub> setkey control capslock
-
-     A key must be an alphabet letter, a digit, or one of these symbols:

-----------------
-
- -- Command: terminal [`--dumb'] [`--no-echo'] [`--no-edit']
-          [`--timeout=secs'] [`--lines=lines'] [`--silent'] [`console']
-          [`serial'] [`hercules']
-     Select a terminal for user interaction. The terminal is assumed to
-     be VT100-compatible unless `--dumb' is specified. If both
-     `console' and `serial' are specified, then GRUB will use the one
-     where a key is entered first or the first when the timeout
-     expires. If neither are specified, the current setting is
-     reported. This command is only available if GRUB is compiled with
-     serial support. See also *Note Serial terminal::.
-
-     This may not make sense for most users, but GRUB supports Hercules
-     console as well. Hercules console is usable like the ordinary
-     console, and the usage is quite similar to that for serial
-     terminals: specify `hercules' as the argument.
-
-     The option `--lines' defines the number of lines in your terminal,
-     and it is used for the internal pager function. If you don't
-     specify this option, the number is assumed as 24.
-
-     The option `--silent' suppresses the message to prompt you to hit
-     any key. This might be useful if your system has no terminal
-     device.
-
-     The option `--no-echo' has GRUB not to echo back input characters.
-     This implies the option `--no-edit'.
-
-     The option `--no-edit' disables the BASH-like editing feature.

-          stage1_file [`d'] dest_dev stage2_file [addr] [`p']
-          [config_file] [real_config_file]
-     This command is fairly complex, and you should not use this command
-     unless you are familiar with GRUB. Use `setup' (*note setup::)
-     instead.
-
-     In short, it will perform a full install presuming the Stage 2 or
-     Stage 1.5(1) (*note install-Footnote-1::) is in its final install
-     location.
-
-     In slightly more detail, it will load STAGE1_FILE, validate that
-     it is a GRUB Stage 1 of the right version number, install in it a
-     blocklist for loading STAGE2_FILE as a Stage 2. If the option `d'
-     is present, the Stage 1 will always look for the actual disk
-     STAGE2_FILE was installed on, rather than using the booting drive.
-     The Stage 2 will be loaded at address ADDR, which must be `0x8000'
-     for a true Stage 2, and `0x2000' for a Stage 1.5. If ADDR is not
-     present, GRUB will determine the address automatically. It then
-     writes the completed Stage 1 to the first block of the device
-     DEST_DEV. If the options `p' or CONFIG_FILE are present, then it
-     reads the first block of stage2, modifies it with the values of
-     the partition STAGE2_FILE was found on (for `p') or places the
-     string CONFIG_FILE into the area telling the stage2 where to look
-     for a configuration file at boot time. Likewise, if
-     REAL_CONFIG_FILE is present and STAGE2_FILE is a Stage 1.5, then
-     the Stage 2 CONFIG_FILE is patched with the configuration file
-     name REAL_CONFIG_FILE. This command preserves the DOS BPB (and for
-     hard disks, the partition table) of the sector the Stage 1 is to
-     be installed into.
-
-     *Caution:* Several buggy BIOSes don't pass a booting drive
-     properly when booting from a hard disk drive. Therefore, you will
-     unfortunately have to specify the option `d', whether your Stage2
-     resides at the booting drive or not, if you have such a BIOS. We
-     know these are defective in this way:
-
-
-          Fujitsu LifeBook 400 BIOS version 31J0103A
-
-
-          HP Vectra XU 6/200 BIOS version GG.06.11
-
-     *Caution2:* A number of BIOSes don't return a correct LBA support
-     bitmap even if they do have the support. So GRUB provides a
-     solution to ignore the wrong bitmap, that is, the option
-     `--force-lba'. Don't use this option if you know that your BIOS
-     doesn't have LBA support.
-
-     *Caution3:* You must specify the option `--stage2' in the grub
-     shell, if you cannot unmount the filesystem where your stage2 file
-     resides. The argument should be the file name in your operating
-     system.

-     command-line". Any modules must be reloaded after using this
-     command.
-
-     This command also accepts the option `--type' so that you can
-     specify the kernel type of FILE explicitly. The argument TYPE must
-     be one of these: `netbsd', `freebsd', `openbsd', `linux',
-     `biglinux', and `multiboot'. However, you need to specify it only
-     if you want to load a NetBSD ELF kernel, because GRUB can
-     automatically determine a kernel type in the other cases, quite
-     safely.
-
-     The option `--no-mem-option' is effective only for Linux. If the
-     option is specified, GRUB doesn't pass the option `mem=' to the

-     command must know what the kernel in question expects). The rest
-     of the line is passed as the "module command-line", like the

-------------
-
- -- Command: root device [hdbias]
-     Set the current "root device" to the device DEVICE, then attempt
-     to mount it to get the partition size (for passing the partition
-     descriptor in `ES:ESI', used by some chain-loaded boot loaders),
-     the BSD drive-type (for booting BSD kernels using their native
-     boot format), and correctly determine the PC partition where a BSD
-     sub-partition is located. The optional HDBIAS parameter is a
-     number to tell a BSD kernel how many BIOS drive numbers are on
-     controllers before the current one. For example, if there is an
-     IDE disk and a SCSI disk, and your FreeBSD root partition is on
-     the SCSI disk, then use a `1' for HDBIAS.

---------------------
-
- -- Command: rootnoverify device [hdbias]
-     Similar to `root' (*note root::), but don't attempt to mount the
-     partition. This is useful for when an OS is outside of the area of
-     the disk that GRUB can read, but setting the correct root device
-     is still desired. Note that the items mentioned in `root' above
-     which derived from attempting the mount will _not_ work correctly.

-
-13.3.33 savedefault
--------------------
-
- -- Command: savedefault num
-     Save the current menu entry or NUM if specified as a default
-     entry. Here is an example:
-
-          default saved
-          timeout 10
-
-          title GNU/Linux
-          root (hd0,0)
-          kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 vga=ext
-          initrd /boot/initrd
-          savedefault
-
-          title FreeBSD
-          root (hd0,a)
-          kernel /boot/loader
-          savedefault
-
-     With this configuration, GRUB will choose the entry booted
-     previously as the default entry.
-
-     You can specify `fallback' instead of a number. Then, next
-     fallback entry is saved. Next fallback entry is chosen from
-     fallback entries. Normally, this will be the first entry in
-     fallback ones.

-13.3.34 setup
--------------
-
- -- Command: setup [`--force-lba'] [`--stage2=os_stage2_file']
-          [`--prefix=dir'] install_device [image_device]
-     Set up the installation of GRUB automatically. This command uses
-     the more flexible command `install' (*note install::) in the
-     backend and installs GRUB into the device INSTALL_DEVICE. If
-     IMAGE_DEVICE is specified, then find the GRUB images (*note
-     Images::) in the device IMAGE_DEVICE, otherwise use the current
-     "root device", which can be set by the command `root'. If
-     INSTALL_DEVICE is a hard disk, then embed a Stage 1.5 in the disk
-     if possible.
-
-     The option `--prefix' specifies the directory under which GRUB
-     images are put. If it is not specified, GRUB automatically
-     searches them in `/boot/grub' and `/grub'.
-
-     The options `--force-lba' and `--stage2' are just passed to
-     `install' if specified. *Note install::, for more information.

-----------------
-
- -- Command: testload file
-     Read the entire contents of FILE in several different ways and
-     compare them, to test the filesystem code. The output is somewhat
-     cryptic, but if no errors are reported and the final `i=X,
-     filepos=Y' reading has X and Y equal, then it is definitely
-     consistent, and very likely works correctly subject to a
-     consistent offset error. If this test succeeds, then a good next
-     step is to try loading a kernel.

-
-     *Caution:* This should be used with great caution, and should only
-     be necessary on some old machines. GRUB's BIOS probe can pick up

-14 Error messages reported by GRUB
-**********************************
-
-This chapter describes error messages reported by GRUB when you
-encounter trouble. *Note Invoking the grub shell::, if your problem is
-specific to the grub shell.
-
-* Menu:
-
-* Stage1 errors::               Errors reported by the Stage 1
-* Stage1.5 errors::             Errors reported by the Stage 1.5

-File: grub.info,  Node: Stage1 errors,  Next: Stage1.5 errors,  Up: Troubleshooting
-
-14.1 Errors reported by the Stage 1
-===================================
-
-The general way that the Stage 1 handles errors is to print an error
-string and then halt. Pressing `<CTRL>-<ALT>-<DEL>' will reboot.
-
-   The following is a comprehensive list of error messages for the
-Stage 1:
-
-Hard Disk Error
-     The stage2 or stage1.5 is being read from a hard disk, and the
-     attempt to determine the size and geometry of the hard disk failed.
-
-Floppy Error
-     The stage2 or stage1.5 is being read from a floppy disk, and the
-     attempt to determine the size and geometry of the floppy disk
-     failed. It's listed as a separate error since the probe sequence
-     is different than for hard disks.
-
-Read Error
-     A disk read error happened while trying to read the stage2 or
-     stage1.5.
-
-Geom Error
-     The location of the stage2 or stage1.5 is not in the portion of
-     the disk supported directly by the BIOS read calls.  This could
-     occur because the BIOS translated geometry has been changed by the
-     user or the disk is moved to another machine or controller after
-     installation, or GRUB was not installed using itself (if it was,
-     the Stage 2 version of this error would have been seen during that
-     process and it would not have completed the install).

-
-14.2 Errors reported by the Stage 1.5
-=====================================
-
-The general way that the Stage 1.5 handles errors is to print an error
-number in the form `Error NUM' and then halt. Pressing
-`<CTRL>-<ALT>-<DEL>' will reboot.
-
-   The error numbers correspond to the errors reported by Stage 2.
-*Note Stage2 errors::.

-File: grub.info,  Node: Stage2 errors,  Prev: Stage1.5 errors,  Up: Troubleshooting
-
-14.3 Errors reported by the Stage 2
-===================================
-
-The general way that the Stage 2 handles errors is to abort the
-operation in question, print an error string, then (if possible) either
-continue based on the fact that an error occurred or wait for the user
-to deal with the error.
-
-   The following is a comprehensive list of error messages for the
-Stage 2 (error numbers for the Stage 1.5 are listed before the colon in
-each description):
-
-1 : Filename must be either an absolute filename or blocklist
-     This error is returned if a file name is requested which doesn't
-     fit the syntax/rules listed in the *Note Filesystem::.
-
-2 : Bad file or directory type
-     This error is returned if a file requested is not a regular file,
-     but something like a symbolic link, directory, or FIFO.
-
-3 : Bad or corrupt data while decompressing file
-     This error is returned if the run-length decompression code gets an
-     internal error. This is usually from a corrupt file.
-
-4 : Bad or incompatible header in compressed file
-     This error is returned if the file header for a supposedly
-     compressed file is bad.
-
-5 : Partition table invalid or corrupt
-     This error is returned if the sanity checks on the integrity of the
-     partition table fail. This is a bad sign.
-
-6 : Mismatched or corrupt version of stage1/stage2
-     This error is returned if the install command points to
-     incompatible or corrupt versions of the stage1 or stage2. It can't
-     detect corruption in general, but this is a sanity check on the
-     version numbers, which should be correct.
-
-7 : Loading below 1MB is not supported
-     This error is returned if the lowest address in a kernel is below
-     the 1MB boundary. The Linux zImage format is a special case and
-     can be handled since it has a fixed loading address and maximum
-     size.
-
-8 : Kernel must be loaded before booting
-     This error is returned if GRUB is told to execute the boot sequence
-     without having a kernel to start.
-
-9 : Unknown boot failure
-     This error is returned if the boot attempt did not succeed for
-     reasons which are unknown.
-
-10 : Unsupported Multiboot features requested
-     This error is returned when the Multiboot features word in the
-     Multiboot header requires a feature that is not recognized. The
-     point of this is that the kernel requires special handling which
-     GRUB is probably unable to provide.
-
-11 : Unrecognized device string
-     This error is returned if a device string was expected, and the
-     string encountered didn't fit the syntax/rules listed in the *Note
-     Filesystem::.
-
-12 : Invalid device requested
-     This error is returned if a device string is recognizable but does
-     not fall under the other device errors.
-
-13 : Invalid or unsupported executable format
-     This error is returned if the kernel image being loaded is not
-     recognized as Multiboot or one of the supported native formats
-     (Linux zImage or bzImage, FreeBSD, or NetBSD).
-
-14 : Filesystem compatibility error, cannot read whole file
-     Some of the filesystem reading code in GRUB has limits on the
-     length of the files it can read. This error is returned when the
-     user runs into such a limit.
-
-15 : File not found
-     This error is returned if the specified file name cannot be found,
-     but everything else (like the disk/partition info) is OK.
-
-16 : Inconsistent filesystem structure
-     This error is returned by the filesystem code to denote an internal
-     error caused by the sanity checks of the filesystem structure on
-     disk not matching what it expects. This is usually caused by a
-     corrupt filesystem or bugs in the code handling it in GRUB.
-
-17 : Cannot mount selected partition
-     This error is returned if the partition requested exists, but the
-     filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB.
-
-18 : Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS
-     This error is returned when a read is attempted at a linear block
-     address beyond the end of the BIOS translated area. This generally
-     happens if your disk is larger than the BIOS can handle (512MB for
-     (E)IDE disks on older machines or larger than 8GB in general).
-
-19 : Linux kernel must be loaded before initrd
-     This error is returned if the initrd command is used before
-     loading a Linux kernel.
-
-20 : Multiboot kernel must be loaded before modules
-     This error is returned if the module load command is used before
-     loading a Multiboot kernel. It only makes sense in this case
-     anyway, as GRUB has no idea how to communicate the presence of
-     such modules to a non-Multiboot-aware kernel.
-
-21 : Selected disk does not exist
-     This error is returned if the device part of a device- or full
-     file name refers to a disk or BIOS device that is not present or
-     not recognized by the BIOS in the system.
-
-22 : No such partition
-     This error is returned if a partition is requested in the device
-     part of a device- or full file name which isn't on the selected
-     disk.
-
-23 : Error while parsing number
-     This error is returned if GRUB was expecting to read a number and
-     encountered bad data.
-
-24 : Attempt to access block outside partition
-     This error is returned if a linear block address is outside of the
-     disk partition. This generally happens because of a corrupt
-     filesystem on the disk or a bug in the code handling it in GRUB
-     (it's a great debugging tool).
-
-25 : Disk read error
-     This error is returned if there is a disk read error when trying to
-     probe or read data from a particular disk.
-
-26 : Too many symbolic links
-     This error is returned if the link count is beyond the maximum
-     (currently 5), possibly the symbolic links are looped.
-
-27 : Unrecognized command
-     This error is returned if an unrecognized command is entered on the
-     command-line or in a boot sequence section of a configuration file
-     and that entry is selected.
-
-28 : Selected item cannot fit into memory
-     This error is returned if a kernel, module, or raw file load
-     command is either trying to load its data such that it won't fit
-     into memory or it is simply too big.
-
-29 : Disk write error
-     This error is returned if there is a disk write error when trying
-     to write to a particular disk. This would generally only occur
-     during an install of set active partition command.
-
-30 : Invalid argument
-     This error is returned if an argument specified to a command is
-     invalid.
-
-31 : File is not sector aligned
-     This error may occur only when you access a ReiserFS partition by
-     block-lists (e.g. the command `install'). In this case, you should
-     mount the partition with the `-o notail' option.
-
-32 : Must be authenticated
-     This error is returned if you try to run a locked entry. You should
-     enter a correct password before running such an entry.
-
-33 : Serial device not configured
-     This error is returned if you try to change your terminal to a
-     serial one before initializing any serial device.
-
-34 : No spare sectors on the disk
-     This error is returned if a disk doesn't have enough spare space.
-     This happens when you try to embed Stage 1.5 into the unused
-     sectors after the MBR, but the first partition starts right after
-     the MBR or they are used by EZ-BIOS.

-15 Invoking the grub shell
-**************************
-
-This chapter documents the grub shell `grub'. Note that the grub shell
-is an emulator; it doesn't run under the native environment, so it
-sometimes does something wrong. Therefore, you shouldn't trust it too
-much. If there is anything wrong with it, don't hesitate to try the
-native GRUB environment, especially when it guesses a wrong map between
-BIOS drives and OS devices.

-
-15.1 Introduction into the grub shell
-=====================================
-
-You can use the command `grub' for installing GRUB under your operating
-systems and for a testbed when you add a new feature into GRUB or when
-fixing a bug. `grub' is almost the same as the Stage 2, and, in fact,
-it shares the source code with the Stage 2 and you can use the same
-commands (*note Commands::) in `grub'. It is emulated by replacing BIOS
-calls with UNIX system calls and libc functions.
-
-   The command `grub' accepts the following options:
-
-`--help'
-     Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
-
-`--version'
-     Print the version number of GRUB and exit.
-
-`--verbose'
-     Print some verbose messages for debugging purpose.
-
-`--device-map=FILE'
-     Use the device map file FILE. The format is described in *Note
-     Device map::.
-
-`--no-floppy'
-     Do not probe any floppy drive. This option has no effect if the
-     option `--device-map' is specified (*note Device map::).
-
-`--probe-second-floppy'
-     Probe the second floppy drive. If this option is not specified,
-     the grub shell does not probe it, as that sometimes takes a long
-     time. If you specify the device map file (*note Device map::), the
-     grub shell just ignores this option.
-
-`--config-file=FILE'
-     Read the configuration file FILE instead of `/boot/grub/menu.lst'.
-     The format is the same as the normal GRUB syntax. See *Note
-     Filesystem::, for more information.
-
-`--boot-drive=DRIVE'
-     Set the stage2 BOOT_DRIVE to DRIVE. This argument should be an
-     integer (decimal, octal or hexadecimal).
-
-`--install-partition=PAR'
-     Set the stage2 INSTALL_PARTITION to PAR. This argument should be
-     an integer (decimal, octal or hexadecimal).
-
-`--no-config-file'
-     Do not use the configuration file even if it can be read.
-
-`--no-curses'
-     Do not use the screen handling interface by the curses even if it
-     is available.
-
-`--batch'
-     This option has the same meaning as `--no-config-file --no-curses'.
-
-`--read-only'
-     Disable writing to any disk.
-
-`--hold'
-     Wait until a debugger will attach. This option is useful when you
-     want to debug the startup code.

-15.2 How to install GRUB via `grub'
-===================================
-
-The installation procedure is the same as under the "native" Stage 2.
-*Note Installation::, for more information. The command `grub'-specific
-information is described here.
-
-   What you should be careful about is "buffer cache". `grub' makes use
-of raw devices instead of filesystems that your operating systems
-serve, so there exists a potential problem that some cache
-inconsistency may corrupt your filesystems. What we recommend is:
-
-   * If you can unmount drives to which GRUB may write any amount of
-     data, unmount them before running `grub'.
-
-   * If a drive cannot be unmounted but can be mounted with the
-     read-only flag, mount it in read-only mode. That should be secure.
-
-   * If a drive must be mounted with the read-write flag, make sure
-     that no activity is being done on it while the command `grub' is
-     running.
-
-   * Reboot your operating system as soon as possible. This is probably
-     not required if you follow the rules above, but reboot is the most
-     secure way.
-
-   In addition, enter the command `quit' when you finish the
-installation. That is _very important_ because `quit' makes the buffer
-cache consistent. Do not push <C-c>.
-
-   If you want to install GRUB non-interactively, specify `--batch'
-option in the command-line. This is a simple example:
-
-     #!/bin/sh
-
-     # Use /usr/sbin/grub if you are on an older system.
-     /sbin/grub --batch <<EOT 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
-     root (hd0,0)
-     setup (hd0)
-     quit
-     EOT
-
-
-File: grub.info,  Node: Device map,  Prev: Installation under UNIX,  Up: Invoking the grub shell
-
-15.3 The map between BIOS drives and OS devices
-===============================================
-
-When you specify the option `--device-map' (*note Basic usage::), the
-grub shell creates the "device map file" automatically unless it
-already exists. The file name `/boot/grub/device.map' is preferred.
-
-   If the device map file exists, the grub shell reads it to map BIOS
-drives to OS devices. This file consists of lines like this:
-
-     DEVICE FILE
-
-   DEVICE is a drive specified in the GRUB syntax (*note Device
-syntax::), and FILE is an OS file, which is normally a device file.
-
-   The reason why the grub shell gives you the device map file is that
-it cannot guess the map between BIOS drives and OS devices correctly in
-some environments. For example, if you exchange the boot sequence
-between IDE and SCSI in your BIOS, it gets the order wrong.
-
-   Thus, edit the file if the grub shell makes a mistake. You can put
-any comments in the file if needed, as the grub shell assumes that a
-line is just a comment if the first character is `#'.

-16 Invoking grub-install
-************************
-
-The program `grub-install' installs GRUB on your drive using the grub
-shell (*note Invoking the grub shell::). You must specify the device
-name on which you want to install GRUB, like this:
-
-     grub-install INSTALL_DEVICE
-
-   The device name INSTALL_DEVICE is an OS device name or a GRUB device
-name.
-
-   `grub-install' accepts the following options:
-
-`--help'
-     Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
-
-`--version'
-     Print the version number of GRUB and exit.
-
-`--force-lba'
-     Force GRUB to use LBA mode even for a buggy BIOS. Use this option
-     only if your BIOS doesn't work properly in LBA mode even though it
-     supports LBA mode.
-
-`--root-directory=DIR'
-     Install GRUB images under the directory DIR instead of the root
-     directory. This option is useful when you want to install GRUB
-     into a separate partition or a removable disk. Here is an example
-     in which you have a separate "boot" partition which is mounted on
-     `/boot':
-
-          grub-install --root-directory=/boot hd0
-
-`--grub-shell=FILE'
-     Use FILE as the grub shell. You can append arbitrary options to
-     FILE after the file name, like this:
-
-          grub-install --grub-shell="grub --read-only" /dev/fd0
-
-`--recheck'
-     Recheck the device map, even if `/boot/grub/device.map' already
-     exists. You should use this option whenever you add/remove a disk
-     into/from your computer.

-**************************
-
-The program `grub-md5-crypt' encrypts a password in MD5 format.  This
-is just a frontend of the grub shell (*note Invoking the grub shell::).
-Passwords encrypted by this program can be used with the command
-`password' (*note password::).
-
-   `grub-md5-crypt' accepts the following options:
-
-`--help'
-     Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
-
-`--version'
-     Print the version information and exit.
-
-`--grub-shell=FILE'

-18 Invoking grub-terminfo
-*************************
-
-The program `grub-terminfo' generates a terminfo command from a
-terminfo name (*note terminfo::). The result can be used in the
-configuration file, to define escape sequences. Because GRUB assumes
-that your terminal is vt100-compatible by default, this would be useful
-only if your terminal is uncommon (such as vt52).
-
-   `grub-terminfo' accepts the following options:
-
-`--help'
-     Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
-
-`--version'
-     Print the version information and exit.
-
-   You must specify one argument to this command. For example:
-
-     grub-terminfo vt52

-19 Invoking grub-set-default
-****************************
-
-The program `grub-set-default' sets the default boot entry for GRUB.
-This automatically creates a file named `default' under your GRUB
-directory (i.e. `/boot/grub'), if it is not present. This file is used
-to determine the default boot entry when GRUB boots up your system when
-you use `default saved' in your configuration file (*note default::),
-and to save next default boot entry when you use `savedefault' in a
-boot entry (*note savedefault::).
-
-   `grub-set-default' accepts the following options:
-
-`--help'
-     Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
-
-`--version'
-     Print the version information and exit.
-
-`--root-directory=DIR'
-     Use the directory DIR instead of the root directory (i.e. `/') to
-     define the location of the default file. This is useful when you
-     mount a disk which is used for another system.
-
-   You must specify a single argument to `grub-set-default'. This
-argument is normally the number of a default boot entry. For example,
-if you have this configuration file:
-
-     default saved
-     timeout 10
-
-     title GNU/Hurd
-     root (hd0,0)
-     ...
-
-     title GNU/Linux
-     root (hd0,1)
-     ...
-
-   and if you want to set the next default boot entry to GNU/Linux, you
-may execute this command:
-
-     grub-set-default 1
-
-   Because the entry for GNU/Linux is `1'. Note that entries are
-counted from zero. So, if you want to specify GNU/Hurd here, then you
-should specify `0'.
-
-   This feature is very useful if you want to test a new kernel or to
-make your system quite robust. *Note Making your system robust::, for
-more hints about how to set up a robust system.

-Appendix A How to obtain and build GRUB
-***************************************
-
-     *Caution:* GRUB requires binutils-2.9.1.0.23 or later because the
-     GNU assembler has been changed so that it can produce real 16bits
-     machine code between 2.9.1 and 2.9.1.0.x. See
-     `http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/', to obtain information on
-     how to get the latest version.
-
-   GRUB is available from the GNU alpha archive site
-`ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub' or any of its mirrors. The file will be
-named grub-version.tar.gz. The current version is 0.96, so the file you
-should grab is:
-
-   `ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/grub-0.96.tar.gz'
-
-   To unbundle GRUB use the instruction:
-
-     zcat grub-0.96.tar.gz | tar xvf -
-
-   which will create a directory called `grub-0.96' with all the
-sources. You can look at the file `INSTALL' for detailed instructions
-on how to build and install GRUB, but you should be able to just do:
-
-     cd grub-0.96
-     ./configure
-     make install
-
-   This will install the grub shell `grub' (*note Invoking the grub
-shell::), the Multiboot checker `mbchk' (*note Invoking mbchk::), and
-the GRUB images. This will also install the GRUB manual.
-
-   Also, the latest version is available from the CVS. See
-`http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=grub' for more information.

-Appendix B Reporting bugs
-*************************
-
-These are the guideline for how to report bugs. Take a look at this
-list below before you submit bugs:
-
-  1. Before getting unsettled, read this manual through and through.
-     Also, see the GNU GRUB FAQ
-     (http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-faq.html).
-
-  2. Always mention the information on your GRUB. The version number
-     and the configuration are quite important. If you build it
-     yourself, write the options specified to the configure script and
-     your operating system, including the versions of gcc and binutils.
-
-  3. If you have trouble with the installation, inform us of how you
-     installed GRUB. Don't omit error messages, if any. Just `GRUB hangs
-     up when it boots' is not enough.
-
-     The information on your hardware is also essential. These are
-     especially important: the geometries and the partition tables of
-     your hard disk drives and your BIOS.
-
-  4. If GRUB cannot boot your operating system, write down _everything_
-     you see on the screen. Don't paraphrase them, like `The foo OS
-     crashes with GRUB, even though it can boot with the bar boot
-     loader just fine'. Mention the commands you executed, the messages
-     printed by them, and information on your operating system
-     including the version number.
-
-  5. Explain what you wanted to do. It is very useful to know your
-     purpose and your wish, and how GRUB didn't satisfy you.
-
-  6. If you can investigate the problem yourself, please do. That will
-     give you and us much more information on the problem. Attaching a
-     patch is even better.
-
-     When you attach a patch, make the patch in unified diff format, and
-     write ChangeLog entries. But, even when you make a patch, don't
-     forget to explain the problem, so that we can understand what your
-     patch is for.
-
-  7. Write down anything that you think might be related. Please
-     understand that we often need to reproduce the same problem you
-     encounterred in our environment. So your information should be
-     sufficient for us to do the same thing--Don't forget that we
-     cannot see your computer directly. If you are not sure whether to
-     state a fact or leave it out, state it!  Reporting too many things
-     is much better than omitting something important.
-
-   If you follow the guideline above, submit a report to the Bug
-Tracking System (http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=grub).
-Alternatively, you can submit a report via electronic mail to
-<bug-grub@gnu.org>, but we strongly recommend that you use the Bug
-Tracking System, because e-mail can be passed over easily.
-
-   Once we get your report, we will try to fix the bugs.

-D.1 The memory map of various components
-========================================
-
-GRUB consists of two distinct components, called "stages", which are
-loaded at different times in the boot process. Because they run
-mutual-exclusively, sometimes a memory area overlaps with another
-memory area. And, even in one stage, a single memory area can be used
-for various purposes, because their usages are mutually exclusive.
-
-   Here is the memory map of the various components:
-
-0 to 4K-1
-     BIOS and real mode interrupts
-
-0x07BE to 0x07FF
-     Partition table passed to another boot loader
-
-down from 8K-1
-     Real mode stack
-
-0x2000 to ?
-     The optional Stage 1.5 is loaded here
-
-0x2000 to 0x7FFF
-     Command-line buffer for Multiboot kernels and modules
-
-0x7C00 to 0x7DFF
-     Stage 1 is loaded here by BIOS or another boot loader
-
-0x7F00 to 0x7F42
-     LBA drive parameters
-
-0x8000 to ?
-     Stage2 is loaded here
-
-The end of Stage 2 to 416K-1
-     Heap, in particular used for the menu
-
-down from 416K-1
-     Protected mode stack
-
-416K to 448K-1
-     Filesystem buffer
-
-448K to 479.5K-1
-     Raw device buffer
-
-479.5K to 480K-1
-     512-byte scratch area
-
-480K to 512K-1
-     Buffers for various functions, such as password, command-line, cut
-     and paste, and completion.
-
-The last 1K of lower memory
-     Disk swapping code and data
-
-   See the file `stage2/shared.h', for more information.

-D.2 Embedded variables in GRUB
-==============================
-
-Stage 1 and Stage 2 have embedded variables whose locations are
-well-defined, so that the installation can patch the binary file
-directly without recompilation of the stages.
-
-   In Stage 1, these are defined:
-
-`0x3E'
-     The version number (not GRUB's, but the installation mechanism's).
-
-`0x40'
-     The boot drive. If it is 0xFF, use a drive passed by BIOS.
-
-`0x41'
-     The flag for if forcing LBA.
-
-`0x42'
-     The starting address of Stage 2.
-
-`0x44'
-     The first sector of Stage 2.
-
-`0x48'
-     The starting segment of Stage 2.
-
-`0x1FE'
-     The signature (`0xAA55').
-
-   See the file `stage1/stage1.S', for more information.
-
-   In the first sector of Stage 1.5 and Stage 2, the block lists are
-recorded between `firstlist' and `lastlist'. The address of `lastlist'
-is determined when assembling the file `stage2/start.S'.
-
-   The trick here is that it is actually read backward, and the first
-8-byte block list is not read here, but after the pointer is decremented
-8 bytes, then after reading it, it decrements again, reads, and so on,
-until it is finished. The terminating condition is when the number of
-sectors to be read in the next block list is zero.
-
-   The format of a block list can be seen from the example in the code
-just before the `firstlist' label. Note that it is always from the
-beginning of the disk, but _not_ relative to the partition boundaries.
-
-   In the second sector of Stage 1.5 and Stage 2, these are defined:
-
-`0x6'
-     The version number (likewise, the installation mechanism's).
-
-`0x8'
-     The installed partition.
-
-`0xC'
-     The saved entry number.
-
-`0x10'
-     The identifier.
-
-`0x11'
-     The flag for if forcing LBA.
-
-`0x12'
-     The version string (GRUB's).
-
-`0x12' + "the length of the version string"
-     The name of a configuration file.
-
-   See the file `stage2/asm.S', for more information.

-
-D.3 The generic interface for filesystems
-=========================================
-
-For any particular partition, it is presumed that only one of the
-"normal" filesystems such as FAT, FFS, or ext2fs can be used, so there
-is a switch table managed by the functions in `disk_io.c'. The notation
-is that you can only "mount" one at a time.
-
-   The block list filesystem has a special place in the system. In
-addition to the "normal" filesystem (or even without one mounted), you
-can access disk blocks directly (in the indicated partition) via the
-block list notation. Using the block list filesystem doesn't effect any
-other filesystem mounts.
-
-   The variables which can be read by the filesystem backend are:
-
-`current_drive'
-     The current BIOS drive number (numbered from 0, if a floppy, and
-     numbered from 0x80, if a hard disk).
-
-`current_partition'
-     The current partition number.
-
-`current_slice'
-     The current partition type.
-
-`saved_drive'
-     The "drive" part of the root device.
-
-`saved_partition'
-     The "partition" part of the root device.
-
-`part_start'
-     The current partition starting address, in sectors.
-
-`part_length'
-     The current partition length, in sectors.
-
-`print_possibilities'
-     True when the `dir' function should print the possible completions
-     of a file, and false when it should try to actually open a file of
-     that name.
-
-`FSYS_BUF'
-     Filesystem buffer which is 32K in size, to use in any way which the
-     filesystem backend desires.
-
-   The variables which need to be written by a filesystem backend are:
-
-`filepos'
-     The current position in the file, in sectors.
-
-     *Caution:* the value of FILEPOS can be changed out from under the
-     filesystem code in the current implementation. Don't depend on it
-     being the same for later calls into the backend code!
-
-`filemax'
-     The length of the file.
-
-`disk_read_func'
-     The value of DISK_READ_HOOK _only_ during reading of data for the
-     file, not any other fs data, inodes, FAT tables, whatever, then
-     set to `NULL' at all other times (it will be `NULL' by default).
-     If this isn't done correctly, then the `testload' and `install'
-     commands won't work correctly.
-
-   The functions expected to be used by the filesystem backend are:
-
-`devread'
-     Only read sectors from within a partition. Sector 0 is the first
-     sector in the partition.
-
-`grub_read'
-     If the backend uses the block list code, then `grub_read' can be
-     used, after setting BLOCK_FILE to 1.
-
-`print_a_completion'
-     If PRINT_POSSIBILITIES is true, call `print_a_completion' for each
-     possible file name. Otherwise, the file name completion won't work.
-
-   The functions expected to be defined by the filesystem backend are
-described at least moderately in the file `filesys.h'. Their usage is
-fairly evident from their use in the functions in `disk_io.c', look for
-the use of the FSYS_TABLE array.
-
-   *Caution:* The semantics are such that then `mount'ing the
-filesystem, presume the filesystem buffer `FSYS_BUF' is corrupted, and
-(re-)load all important contents. When opening and reading a file,
-presume that the data from the `mount' is available, and doesn't get
-corrupted by the open/read (i.e. multiple opens and/or reads will be
-done with only one mount if in the same filesystem).

-
-D.4 The generic interface for built-ins
-=======================================
-
-GRUB built-in commands are defined in a uniformal interface, whether
-they are menu-specific or can be used anywhere. The definition of a
-builtin command consists of two parts: the code itself and the table of
-the information.
-
-   The code must be a function which takes two arguments, a command-line
-string and flags, and returns an `int' value. The "flags" argument
-specifies how the function is called, using a bit mask. The return
-value must be zero if successful, otherwise non-zero. So it is normally
-enough to return ERRNUM.
-
-   The table of the information is represented by the structure `struct
-builtin', which contains the name of the command, a pointer to the
-function, flags, a short description of the command and a long
-description of the command. Since the descriptions are used only for
-help messages interactively, you don't have to define them, if the
-command may not be called interactively (such as `title').
-
-   The table is finally registered in the table BUILTIN_TABLE, so that
-`run_script' and `enter_cmdline' can find the command. See the files
-`cmdline.c' and `builtins.c', for more details.
-

-File: grub.info,  Node: Bootstrap tricks,  Next: I/O ports detection,  Prev: Command interface,  Up: Internals
-
-D.5 The bootstrap mechanism used in GRUB
-========================================
-
-The disk space can be used in a boot loader is very restricted because
-a MBR (*note MBR::) is only 512 bytes but it also contains a partition
-table (*note Partition table::) and a BPB. So the question is how to
-make a boot loader code enough small to be fit in a MBR.
-
-   However, GRUB is a very large program, so we break GRUB into 2 (or 3)
-distinct components, "Stage 1" and "Stage 2" (and optionally "Stage
-1.5"). *Note Memory map::, for more information.
-
-   We embed Stage 1 in a MBR or in the boot sector of a partition, and
-place Stage 2 in a filesystem. The optional Stage 1.5 can be installed
-in a filesystem, in the "boot loader" area in a FFS or a ReiserFS, and
-in the sectors right after a MBR, because Stage 1.5 is enough small and
-the sectors right after a MBR is normally an unused region. The size of
-this region is the number of sectors per head minus 1.
-
-   Thus, all Stage1 must do is just load Stage2 or Stage1.5. But even if
-Stage 1 needs not to support the user interface or the filesystem
-interface, it is impossible to make Stage 1 less than 400 bytes, because
-GRUB should support both the CHS mode and the LBA mode (*note Low-level
-disk I/O::).
-
-   The solution used by GRUB is that Stage 1 loads only the first
-sector of Stage 2 (or Stage 1.5) and Stage 2 itself loads the rest. The
-flow of Stage 1 is:
-
-  1. Initialize the system briefly.
-
-  2. Detect the geometry and the accessing mode of the "loading drive".
-
-  3. Load the first sector of Stage 2.
-
-  4. Jump to the starting address of the Stage 2.
-
-   The flow of Stage 2 (and Stage 1.5) is:
-
-  1. Load the rest of itself to the real starting address, that is, the
-     starting address plus 512 bytes. The block lists are stored in the
-     last part of the first sector.
-
-  2. Long jump to the real starting address.
-
-   Note that Stage 2 (or Stage 1.5) does not probe the geometry or the
-accessing mode of the "loading drive", since Stage 1 has already probed
-them.

-When you write patches for GRUB, please send them to the mailing list
-<bug-grub@gnu.org>. Here is the list of items of which you should take
-care:
-
-   * Please make your patch as small as possible. Generally, it is not
-     a good thing to make one big patch which changes many things.
-     Instead, segregate features and produce many patches.
-
-   * Use as late code as possible, for the original code. The CVS
-     repository always has the current version (*note Obtaining and
-     Building GRUB::).
-
-   * Write ChangeLog entries. *Note Change Logs: (standards)Change
-     Logs, if you don't know how to write ChangeLog.
-
-   * Make patches in unified diff format. `diff -urN' is appropriate in
-     most cases.
-
-   * Don't make patches reversely. Reverse patches are difficult to
-     read and use.
-
-   * Be careful enough of the license term and the copyright. Because
-     GRUB is under GNU General Public License, you may not steal code
-     from software whose license is incompatible against GPL. And, if
-     you copy code written by others, you must not ignore their
-     copyrights. Feel free to ask GRUB maintainers, whenever you are
-     not sure what you should do.
-
-   * If your patch is too large to send in e-mail, put it at somewhere
-     we can see. Usually, you shouldn't send e-mail over 20K.

-1.1 The background of Multiboot Specification
-=============================================
-
-Every operating system ever created tends to have its own boot loader.
-Installing a new operating system on a machine generally involves
-installing a whole new set of boot mechanisms, each with completely
-different install-time and boot-time user interfaces. Getting multiple
-operating systems to coexist reliably on one machine through typical
-"chaining" mechanisms can be a nightmare. There is little or no choice
-of boot loaders for a particular operating system -- if the one that
-comes with the operating system doesn't do exactly what you want, or
-doesn't work on your machine, you're screwed.
-
-   While we may not be able to fix this problem in existing commercial
-operating systems, it shouldn't be too difficult for a few people in the
-free operating system communities to put their heads together and solve
-this problem for the popular free operating systems. That's what this
-specification aims for. Basically, it specifies an interface between a
-boot loader and a operating system, such that any complying boot loader
-should be able to load any complying operating system. This
-specification does _not_ specify how boot loaders should work -- only
-how they must interface with the operating system being loaded.

-
-1.2 The target architecture
-===========================
-
-This specification is primarily targeted at PC, since they are the most
-common and have the largest variety of operating systems and boot
-loaders. However, to the extent that certain other architectures may
-need a boot specification and do not have one already, a variation of
-this specification, stripped of the x86-specific details, could be
-adopted for them as well.

-File: multiboot.info,  Node: Operating systems,  Next: Boot sources,  Prev: Architecture,  Up: Overview
-
-1.3 The target operating systems
-================================
-
-This specification is targeted toward free 32-bit operating systems
-that can be fairly easily modified to support the specification without
-going through lots of bureaucratic rigmarole. The particular free
-operating systems that this specification is being primarily designed
-for are Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mach, and VSTa. It is hoped that other
-emerging free operating systems will adopt it from the start, and thus
-immediately be able to take advantage of existing boot loaders. It would
-be nice if commercial operating system vendors eventually adopted this
-specification as well, but that's probably a pipe dream.

-
-1.4 Boot sources
-================
-
-It should be possible to write compliant boot loaders that load the OS
-image from a variety of sources, including floppy disk, hard disk, and
-across a network.
-
-   Disk-based boot loaders may use a variety of techniques to find the
-relevant OS image and boot module data on disk, such as by
-interpretation of specific file systems (e.g. the BSD/Mach boot loader),
-using precalculated "block lists" (e.g. LILO), loading from a special
-"boot partition" (e.g. OS/2), or even loading from within another
-operating system (e.g. the VSTa boot code, which loads from DOS).
-Similarly, network-based boot loaders could use a variety of network
-hardware and protocols.
-
-   It is hoped that boot loaders will be created that support multiple
-loading mechanisms, increasing their portability, robustness, and
-user-friendliness.

-
-1.5 Configure an operating system at boot-time
-==============================================
-
-It is often necessary for one reason or another for the user to be able
-to provide some configuration information to an operating system
-dynamically at boot time. While this specification should not dictate
-how this configuration information is obtained by the boot loader, it
-should provide a standard means for the boot loader to pass such
-information to the operating system.
-
-
-File: multiboot.info,  Node: Convenience to operating systems,  Next: Boot modules,  Prev: Boot-time configuration,  Up: Overview
-
-1.6 How to make OS development easier
-=====================================
-
-OS images should be easy to generate. Ideally, an OS image should simply
-be an ordinary 32-bit executable file in whatever file format the
-operating system normally uses. It should be possible to `nm' or
-disassemble OS images just like normal executables. Specialized tools
-should not be required to create OS images in a _special_ file format.
-If this means shifting some work from the operating system to a boot
-loader, that is probably appropriate, because all the memory consumed
-by the boot loader will typically be made available again after the
-boot process is created, whereas every bit of code in the OS image
-typically has to remain in memory forever. The operating system should
-not have to worry about getting into 32-bit mode initially, because mode
-switching code generally needs to be in the boot loader anyway in order
-to load operating system data above the 1MB boundary, and forcing the
-operating system to do this makes creation of OS images much more
-difficult.
-
-   Unfortunately, there is a horrendous variety of executable file
-formats even among free Unix-like PC-based operating systems --
-generally a different format for each operating system. Most of the
-relevant free operating systems use some variant of a.out format, but
-some are moving to ELF. It is highly desirable for boot loaders not to
-have to be able to interpret all the different types of executable file
-formats in existence in order to load the OS image -- otherwise the
-boot loader effectively becomes operating system specific again.
-
-   This specification adopts a compromise solution to this problem.
-Multiboot-compliant OS images always contain a magic "Multiboot header"
-(*note OS image format::), which allows the boot loader to load the
-image without having to understand numerous a.out variants or other
-executable formats. This magic header does not need to be at the very
-beginning of the executable file, so kernel images can still conform to
-the local a.out format variant in addition to being Multiboot-compliant.
-
-
-File: multiboot.info,  Node: Boot modules,  Prev: Convenience to operating systems,  Up: Overview
-
-1.7 Boot modules
-================
-
-Many modern operating system kernels, such as those of VSTa and Mach, do
-not by themselves contain enough mechanism to get the system fully
-operational: they require the presence of additional software modules at
-boot time in order to access devices, mount file systems, etc. While
-these additional modules could be embedded in the main OS image along
-with the kernel itself, and the resulting image be split apart manually
-by the operating system when it receives control, it is often more
-flexible, more space-efficient, and more convenient to the operating
-system and user if the boot loader can load these additional modules
-independently in the first place.
-
-   Thus, this specification should provide a standard method for a boot
-loader to indicate to the operating system what auxiliary boot modules
-were loaded, and where they can be found. Boot loaders don't have to
-support multiple boot modules, but they are strongly encouraged to,
-because some operating systems will be unable to boot without them.

-
-2 The definitions of terms used through the specification
-*********************************************************
-
-"must"
-     We use the term "must", when any boot loader or OS image needs to
-     follow a rule -- otherwise, the boot loader or OS image is _not_
-     Multiboot-compliant.
-
-"should"
-     We use the term "should", when any boot loader or OS image is
-     recommended to follow a rule, but it doesn't need to follow the
-     rule.
-
-"may"
-     We use the term "may", when any boot loader or OS image is allowed
-     to follow a rule.
-
-"boot loader"
-     Whatever program or set of programs loads the image of the final
-     operating system to be run on the machine. The boot loader may
-     itself consist of several stages, but that is an implementation
-     detail not relevant to this specification. Only the _final_ stage
-     of the boot loader -- the stage that eventually transfers control
-     to an operating system -- must follow the rules specified in this
-     document in order to be "Multiboot-compliant"; earlier boot loader
-     stages may be designed in whatever way is most convenient.
-
-"OS image"
-     The initial binary image that a boot loader loads into memory and
-     transfers control to start an operating system. The OS image is
-     typically an executable containing the operating system kernel.
-
-"boot module"
-     Other auxiliary files that a boot loader loads into memory along
-     with an OS image, but does not interpret in any way other than
-     passing their locations to the operating system when it is invoked.
-
-"Multiboot-compliant"
-     A boot loader or an OS image which follows the rules defined as
-     "must" is Multiboot-compliant. When this specification specifies a
-     rule as "should" or "may", a Multiboot-complaint boot loader/OS
-     image doesn't need to follow the rule.
-
-"u8"
-     The type of unsigned 8-bit data.
-
-"u16"
-     The type of unsigned 16-bit data. Because the target architecture
-     is little-endian, u16 is coded in little-endian.
-
-"u32"
-     The type of unsigned 32-bit data. Because the target architecture
-     is little-endian, u32 is coded in little-endian.
-
-"u64"
-     The type of unsigned 64-bit data. Because the target architecture
-     is little-endian, u64 is coded in little-endian.

-3 The exact definitions of Multiboot Specification
-**************************************************
-
-There are three main aspects of a boot loader/OS image interface:
-
-  1. The format of an OS image as seen by a boot loader.
-
-  2. The state of a machine when a boot loader starts an operating
-     system.
-
-  3. The format of information passed by a boot loader to an operating
-     system.

-
-3.1 OS image format
-===================
-
-An OS image may be an ordinary 32-bit executable file in the standard
-format for that particular operating system, except that it may be
-linked at a non-default load address to avoid loading on top of the
-PC's I/O region or other reserved areas, and of course it should not
-use shared libraries or other fancy features.
-
-   An OS image must contain an additional header called "Multiboot
-header", besides the headers of the format used by the OS image. The
-Multiboot header must be contained completely within the first 8192
-bytes of the OS image, and must be longword (32-bit) aligned. In
-general, it should come _as early as possible_, and may be embedded in
-the beginning of the text segment after the _real_ executable header.

-
-3.1.1 The layout of Multiboot header
-------------------------------------
-
-The layout of the Multiboot header must be as follows:
-
-Offset  Type    Field Name     Note
-0       u32     magic          required
-4       u32     flags          required

-
-3.1.2 The magic fields of Multiboot header
-------------------------------------------
-
-`magic'
-     The field `magic' is the magic number identifying the header,
-     which must be the hexadecimal value `0x1BADB002'.
-
-`flags'
-     The field `flags' specifies features that the OS image requests or
-     requires of an boot loader. Bits 0-15 indicate requirements; if the
-     boot loader sees any of these bits set but doesn't understand the
-     flag or can't fulfill the requirements it indicates for some
-     reason, it must notify the user and fail to load the OS image.
-     Bits 16-31 indicate optional features; if any bits in this range
-     are set but the boot loader doesn't understand them, it may simply
-     ignore them and proceed as usual. Naturally, all as-yet-undefined
-     bits in the `flags' word must be set to zero in OS images. This
-     way, the `flags' fields serves for version control as well as
-     simple feature selection.
-
-     If bit 0 in the `flags' word is set, then all boot modules loaded
-     along with the operating system must be aligned on page (4KB)
-     boundaries. Some operating systems expect to be able to map the
-     pages containing boot modules directly into a paged address space
-     during startup, and thus need the boot modules to be page-aligned.
-
-     If bit 1 in the `flags' word is set, then information on available
-     memory via at least the `mem_*' fields of the Multiboot information
-     structure (*note Boot information format::) must be included. If
-     the boot loader is capable of passing a memory map (the `mmap_*'
-     fields) and one exists, then it may be included as well.
-
-     If bit 2 in the `flags' word is set, information about the video
-     mode table (*note Boot information format::) must be available to
-     the kernel.
-
-     If bit 16 in the `flags' word is set, then the fields at offsets
-     8-24 in the Multiboot header are valid, and the boot loader should
-     use them instead of the fields in the actual executable header to
-     calculate where to load the OS image. This information does not
-     need to be provided if the kernel image is in ELF format, but it
-     _must_ be provided if the images is in a.out format or in some
-     other format. Compliant boot loaders must be able to load images
-     that either are in ELF format or contain the load address
-     information embedded in the Multiboot header; they may also
-     directly support other executable formats, such as particular
-     a.out variants, but are not required to.
-
-`checksum'
-     The field `checksum' is a 32-bit unsigned value which, when added
-     to the other magic fields (i.e. `magic' and `flags'), must have a
-     32-bit unsigned sum of zero.

-
-3.1.3 The address fields of Multiboot header
---------------------------------------------
-
-All of the address fields enabled by flag bit 16 are physical addresses.
-The meaning of each is as follows:
-
-`header_addr'
-     Contains the address corresponding to the beginning of the
-     Multiboot header -- the physical memory location at which the
-     magic value is supposed to be loaded. This field serves to
-     "synchronize" the mapping between OS image offsets and physical
-     memory addresses.
-
-`load_addr'
-     Contains the physical address of the beginning of the text
-     segment. The offset in the OS image file at which to start loading
-     is defined by the offset at which the header was found, minus
-     (header_addr - load_addr). load_addr must be less than or equal to
-     header_addr.
-
-`load_end_addr'
-     Contains the physical address of the end of the data segment.
-     (load_end_addr - load_addr) specifies how much data to load.  This
-     implies that the text and data segments must be consecutive in the
-     OS image; this is true for existing a.out executable formats.  If
-     this field is zero, the boot loader assumes that the text and data
-     segments occupy the whole OS image file.
-
-`bss_end_addr'
-     Contains the physical address of the end of the bss segment. The
-     boot loader initializes this area to zero, and reserves the memory
-     it occupies to avoid placing boot modules and other data relevant
-     to the operating system in that area. If this field is zero, the
-     boot loader assumes that no bss segment is present.
-
-`entry_addr'
-     The physical address to which the boot loader should jump in order
-     to start running the operating system.
-
-
-File: multiboot.info,  Node: Header graphics fields,  Prev: Header address fields,  Up: OS image format
-
-3.1.4 The graphics fields of Multiboot header
----------------------------------------------
-
-All of the graphics fields are enabled by flag bit 2. They specify the
-preferred graphics mode. Note that that is only a _recommended_ mode by
-the OS image. If the mode exists, the boot loader should set it, when
-the user doesn't specify a mode explicitly. Otherwise, the boot loader
-should fall back to a similar mode, if available.
-
-   The meaning of each is as follows:
-
-`mode_type'
-     Contains `0' for linear graphics mode or `1' for EGA-standard text
-     mode. Everything else is reserved for future expansion. Note that
-     the boot loader may set a text mode, even if this field contains
-     `0'.
-
-`width'
-     Contains the number of the columns. This is specified in pixels in
-     a graphics mode, and in characters in a text mode. The value zero
-     indicates that the OS image has no preference.
-
-`height'
-     Contains the number of the lines. This is specified in pixels in a
-     graphics mode, and in characters in a text mode. The value zero
-     indicates that the OS image has no preference.
-
-`depth'
-     Contains the number of bits per pixel in a graphics mode, and zero
-     in a text mode. The value zero indicates that the OS image has no
-     preference.

-
-3.2 Machine state
-=================
-
-When the boot loader invokes the 32-bit operating system, the machine
-must have the following state:
-
-`EAX'
-     Must contain the magic value `0x2BADB002'; the presence of this
-     value indicates to the operating system that it was loaded by a
-     Multiboot-compliant boot loader (e.g. as opposed to another type of
-     boot loader that the operating system can also be loaded from).
-
-`EBX'
-     Must contain the 32-bit physical address of the Multiboot
-     information structure provided by the boot loader (*note Boot
-     information format::).
-
-`CS'
-     Must be a 32-bit read/execute code segment with an offset of `0'
-     and a limit of `0xFFFFFFFF'. The exact value is undefined.
-
-`DS'
-`ES'
-`FS'
-`GS'
-`SS'
-     Must be a 32-bit read/write data segment with an offset of `0' and
-     a limit of `0xFFFFFFFF'. The exact values are all undefined.
-
-`A20 gate'
-     Must be enabled.
-
-`CR0'
-     Bit 31 (PG) must be cleared. Bit 0 (PE) must be set. Other bits are
-     all undefined.
-
-`EFLAGS'
-     Bit 17 (VM) must be cleared. Bit 9 (IF) must be cleared. Other bits
-     are all undefined.
-
-   All other processor registers and flag bits are undefined. This
-includes, in particular:
-
-`ESP'
-     The OS image must create its own stack as soon as it needs one.
-
-`GDTR'
-     Even though the segment registers are set up as described above,
-     the `GDTR' may be invalid, so the OS image must not load any
-     segment registers (even just reloading the same values!) until it
-     sets up its own `GDT'.
-
-`IDTR'
-     The OS image must leave interrupts disabled until it sets up its
-     own `IDT'.
-
-   However, other machine state should be left by the boot loader in
-"normal working order", i.e. as initialized by the BIOS (or DOS, if
-that's what the boot loader runs from). In other words, the operating
-system should be able to make BIOS calls and such after being loaded,
-as long as it does not overwrite the BIOS data structures before doing
-so. Also, the boot loader must leave the PIC programmed with the normal
-BIOS/DOS values, even if it changed them during the switch to 32-bit
-mode.

-
-3.3 Boot information format
-===========================
-
-FIXME: Split this chapter like the chapter "OS image format".
-
-   Upon entry to the operating system, the `EBX' register contains the
-physical address of a "Multiboot information" data structure, through
-which the boot loader communicates vital information to the operating
-system. The operating system can use or ignore any parts of the
-structure as it chooses; all information passed by the boot loader is
-advisory only.
-
-   The Multiboot information structure and its related substructures
-may be placed anywhere in memory by the boot loader (with the exception
-of the memory reserved for the kernel and boot modules, of course). It
-is the operating system's responsibility to avoid overwriting this
-memory until it is done using it.
-
-   The format of the Multiboot information structure (as defined so far)
-follows:
-
-             +-------------------+
-     0       | flags             |    (required)
-             +-------------------+
-     4       | mem_lower         |    (present if flags[0] is set)
-     8       | mem_upper         |    (present if flags[0] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     12      | boot_device       |    (present if flags[1] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     16      | cmdline           |    (present if flags[2] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     20      | mods_count        |    (present if flags[3] is set)
-     24      | mods_addr         |    (present if flags[3] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     28 - 40 | syms              |    (present if flags[4] or
-             |                   |                flags[5] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     44      | mmap_length       |    (present if flags[6] is set)
-     48      | mmap_addr         |    (present if flags[6] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     52      | drives_length     |    (present if flags[7] is set)
-     56      | drives_addr       |    (present if flags[7] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     60      | config_table      |    (present if flags[8] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     64      | boot_loader_name  |    (present if flags[9] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     68      | apm_table         |    (present if flags[10] is set)
-             +-------------------+
-     72      | vbe_control_info  |    (present if flags[11] is set)
-     76      | vbe_mode_info     |
-     80      | vbe_mode          |
-     82      | vbe_interface_seg |
-     84      | vbe_interface_off |
-     86      | vbe_interface_len |
-             +-------------------+
-
-   The first longword indicates the presence and validity of other
-fields in the Multiboot information structure. All as-yet-undefined
-bits must be set to zero by the boot loader. Any set bits that the
-operating system does not understand should be ignored. Thus, the
-`flags' field also functions as a version indicator, allowing the
-Multiboot information structure to be expanded in the future without
-breaking anything.
-
-   If bit 0 in the `flags' word is set, then the `mem_*' fields are
-valid. `mem_lower' and `mem_upper' indicate the amount of lower and
-upper memory, respectively, in kilobytes. Lower memory starts at
-address 0, and upper memory starts at address 1 megabyte. The maximum
-possible value for lower memory is 640 kilobytes. The value returned for
-upper memory is maximally the address of the first upper memory hole
-minus 1 megabyte. It is not guaranteed to be this value.
-
-   If bit 1 in the `flags' word is set, then the `boot_device' field is
-valid, and indicates which BIOS disk device the boot loader loaded the
-OS image from. If the OS image was not loaded from a BIOS disk, then
-this field must not be present (bit 3 must be clear). The operating
-system may use this field as a hint for determining its own "root"
-device, but is not required to. The `boot_device' field is laid out in
-four one-byte subfields as follows:
-
-     +-------+-------+-------+-------+
-     | drive | part1 | part2 | part3 |
-     +-------+-------+-------+-------+
-
-   The first byte contains the BIOS drive number as understood by the
-BIOS INT 0x13 low-level disk interface: e.g. 0x00 for the first floppy
-disk or 0x80 for the first hard disk.
-
-   The three remaining bytes specify the boot partition. `part1'
-specifies the "top-level" partition number, `part2' specifies a
-"sub-partition" in the top-level partition, etc. Partition numbers
-always start from zero. Unused partition bytes must be set to 0xFF. For
-example, if the disk is partitioned using a simple one-level DOS
-partitioning scheme, then `part1' contains the DOS partition number,
-and `part2' and `part3' are both 0xFF. As another example, if a disk is
-partitioned first into DOS partitions, and then one of those DOS
-partitions is subdivided into several BSD partitions using BSD's
-"disklabel" strategy, then `part1' contains the DOS partition number,
-`part2' contains the BSD sub-partition within that DOS partition, and
-`part3' is 0xFF.
-
-   DOS extended partitions are indicated as partition numbers starting
-from 4 and increasing, rather than as nested sub-partitions, even
-though the underlying disk layout of extended partitions is
-hierarchical in nature. For example, if the boot loader boots from the
-second extended partition on a disk partitioned in conventional DOS
-style, then `part1' will be 5, and `part2' and `part3' will both be
-0xFF.
-
-   If bit 2 of the `flags' longword is set, the `cmdline' field is
-valid, and contains the physical address of the command line to be
-passed to the kernel. The command line is a normal C-style
-zero-terminated string.
-
-   If bit 3 of the `flags' is set, then the `mods' fields indicate to
-the kernel what boot modules were loaded along with the kernel image,
-and where they can be found. `mods_count' contains the number of
-modules loaded; `mods_addr' contains the physical address of the first
-module structure. `mods_count' may be zero, indicating no boot modules
-were loaded, even if bit 1 of `flags' is set. Each module structure is
-formatted as follows:
-
-             +-------------------+
-     0       | mod_start         |
-     4       | mod_end           |
-             +-------------------+
-     8       | string            |
-             +-------------------+
-     12      | reserved (0)      |
-             +-------------------+
-
-   The first two fields contain the start and end addresses of the boot
-module itself. The `string' field provides an arbitrary string to be
-associated with that particular boot module; it is a zero-terminated
-ASCII string, just like the kernel command line. The `string' field may
-be 0 if there is no string associated with the module. Typically the
-string might be a command line (e.g. if the operating system treats boot
-modules as executable programs), or a pathname (e.g. if the operating
-system treats boot modules as files in a file system), but its exact use
-is specific to the operating system. The `reserved' field must be set
-to 0 by the boot loader and ignored by the operating system.
-
-   *Caution:* Bits 4 & 5 are mutually exclusive.
-
-   If bit 4 in the `flags' word is set, then the following fields in
-the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:
-
-             +-------------------+
-     28      | tabsize           |
-     32      | strsize           |
-     36      | addr              |
-     40      | reserved (0)      |
-             +-------------------+
-
-   These indicate where the symbol table from an a.out kernel image can
-be found. `addr' is the physical address of the size (4-byte unsigned
-long) of an array of a.out format "nlist" structures, followed
-immediately by the array itself, then the size (4-byte unsigned long) of
-a set of zero-terminated ASCII strings (plus sizeof(unsigned long) in
-this case), and finally the set of strings itself. `tabsize' is equal
-to its size parameter (found at the beginning of the symbol section),
-and `strsize' is equal to its size parameter (found at the beginning of
-the string section) of the following string table to which the symbol
-table refers. Note that `tabsize' may be 0, indicating no symbols, even
-if bit 4 in the `flags' word is set.
-
-   If bit 5 in the `flags' word is set, then the following fields in
-the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:
-
-             +-------------------+
-     28      | num               |
-     32      | size              |
-     36      | addr              |
-     40      | shndx             |
-             +-------------------+
-
-   These indicate where the section header table from an ELF kernel is,
-the size of each entry, number of entries, and the string table used as
-the index of names. They correspond to the `shdr_*' entries
-(`shdr_num', etc.) in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
-specification in the program header. All sections are loaded, and the
-physical address fields of the ELF section header then refer to where
-the sections are in memory (refer to the i386 ELF documentation for
-details as to how to read the section header(s)). Note that `shdr_num'
-may be 0, indicating no symbols, even if bit 5 in the `flags' word is
-set.
-
-   If bit 6 in the `flags' word is set, then the `mmap_*' fields are
-valid, and indicate the address and length of a buffer containing a
-memory map of the machine provided by the BIOS. `mmap_addr' is the
-address, and `mmap_length' is the total size of the buffer. The buffer
-consists of one or more of the following size/structure pairs (`size'
-is really used for skipping to the next pair):
-
-             +-------------------+
-     -4      | size              |
-             +-------------------+
-     0       | base_addr_low     |
-     4       | base_addr_high    |
-     8       | length_low        |
-     12      | length_high       |
-     16      | type              |
-             +-------------------+
-
-   where `size' is the size of the associated structure in bytes, which
-can be greater than the minimum of 20 bytes. `base_addr_low' is the
-lower 32 bits of the starting address, and `base_addr_high' is the
-upper 32 bits, for a total of a 64-bit starting address. `length_low'
-is the lower 32 bits of the size of the memory region in bytes, and
-`length_high' is the upper 32 bits, for a total of a 64-bit length.
-`type' is the variety of address range represented, where a value of 1
-indicates available RAM, and all other values currently indicated a
-reserved area.
-
-   The map provided is guaranteed to list all standard RAM that should
-be available for normal use.
-
-   If bit 7 in the `flags' is set, then the `drives_*' fields are
-valid, and indicate the address of the physical address of the first
-drive structure and the size of drive structures. `drives_addr' is the
-address, and `drives_length' is the total size of drive structures.
-Note that `drives_length' may be zero. Each drive structure is
-formatted as follows:
-
-             +-------------------+
-     0       | size              |
-             +-------------------+
-     4       | drive_number      |
-             +-------------------+
-     5       | drive_mode        |
-             +-------------------+
-     6       | drive_cylinders   |
-     8       | drive_heads       |
-     9       | drive_sectors     |
-             +-------------------+
-     10 - xx | drive_ports       |
-             +-------------------+
-
-   The `size' field specifies the size of this structure. The size
-varies, depending on the number of ports. Note that the size may not be
-equal to (10 + 2 * the number of ports), because of an alignment.
-
-   The `drive_number' field contains the BIOS drive number. The
-`drive_mode' field represents the access mode used by the boot loader.
-Currently, the following modes are defined:
-
-`0'
-     CHS mode (traditional cylinder/head/sector addressing mode).
-
-`1'
-     LBA mode (Logical Block Addressing mode).
-
-   The three fields, `drive_cylinders', `drive_heads' and
-`drive_sectors', indicate the geometry of the drive detected by the
-BIOS. `drive_cylinders' contains the number of the cylinders.
-`drive_heads' contains the number of the heads. `drive_sectors'
-contains the number of the sectors per track.
-
-   The `drive_ports' field contains the array of the I/O ports used for
-the drive in the BIOS code. The array consists of zero or more unsigned
-two-bytes integers, and is terminated with zero. Note that the array
-may contain any number of I/O ports that are not related to the drive
-actually (such as DMA controller's ports).
-
-   If bit 8 in the `flags' is set, then the `config_table' field is
-valid, and indicates the address of the ROM configuration table
-returned by the "GET CONFIGURATION" BIOS call. If the BIOS call fails,
-then the size of the table must be _zero_.
-
-   If bit 9 in the `flags' is set, the `boot_loader_name' field is
-valid, and contains the physical address of the name of a boot loader
-booting the kernel. The name is a normal C-style zero-terminated string.
-
-   If bit 10 in the `flags' is set, the `apm_table' field is valid, and
-contains the physical address of an APM table defined as below:
-
-             +----------------------+
-     0       | version              |
-     2       | cseg                 |
-     4       | offset               |
-     8       | cseg_16              |
-     10      | dseg                 |
-     12      | flags                |
-     14      | cseg_len             |
-     16      | cseg_16_len          |
-     18      | dseg_len             |
-             +----------------------+
-
-   The fields `version', `cseg', `offset', `cseg_16', `dseg', `flags',
-`cseg_len', `cseg_16_len', `dseg_len' indicate the version number, the
-protected mode 32-bit code segment, the offset of the entry point, the
-protected mode 16-bit code segment, the protected mode 16-bit data
-segment, the flags, the length of the protected mode 32-bit code
-segment, the length of the protected mode 16-bit code segment, and the
-length of the protected mode 16-bit data segment, respectively. Only
-the field `offset' is 4 bytes, and the others are 2 bytes. See Advanced
-Power Management (APM) BIOS Interface Specification
-(http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/busbios/amp_12.htm), for more
-information.
-
-   If bit 11 in the `flags' is set, the graphics table is available.
-This must only be done if the kernel has indicated in the `Multiboot
-Header' that it accepts a graphics mode.
-
-   The fields `vbe_control_info' and `vbe_mode_info' contain the
-physical addresses of VBE control information returned by the VBE
-Function 00h and VBE mode information returned by the VBE Function 01h,
-respectively.
-
-   The field `vbe_mode' indicates current video mode in the format
-specified in VBE 3.0.
-
-   The rest fields `vbe_interface_seg', `vbe_interface_off', and
-`vbe_interface_len' contain the table of a protected mode interface
-defined in VBE 2.0+. If this information is not available, those fields
-contain zero. Note that VBE 3.0 defines another protected mode
-interface which is incompatible with the old one. If you want to use
-the new protected mode interface, you will have to find the table
-yourself.
-
-   The fields for the graphics table are designed for VBE, but
-Multiboot boot loaders may simulate VBE on non-VBE modes, as if they
-were VBE modes.

-4.1 Notes on PC
-===============
-
-In reference to bit 0 of the `flags' parameter in the Multiboot
-information structure, if the bootloader in question uses older BIOS
-interfaces, or the newest ones are not available (see description about
-bit 6), then a maximum of either 15 or 63 megabytes of memory may be
-reported. It is _highly_ recommended that boot loaders perform a
-thorough memory probe.
-
-   In reference to bit 1 of the `flags' parameter in the Multiboot
-information structure, it is recognized that determination of which
-BIOS drive maps to which device driver in an operating system is
-non-trivial, at best. Many kludges have been made to various operating
-systems instead of solving this problem, most of them breaking under
-many conditions. To encourage the use of general-purpose solutions to
-this problem, there are 2 BIOS device mapping techniques (*note BIOS
-device mapping techniques::).
-
-   In reference to bit 6 of the `flags' parameter in the Multiboot
-information structure, it is important to note that the data structure
-used there (starting with `BaseAddrLow') is the data returned by the
-INT 15h, AX=E820h -- Query System Address Map call. See *Note Query
-System Address Map: (grub.info)Query System Address Map, for more
-information. The interface here is meant to allow a boot loader to work
-unmodified with any reasonable extensions of the BIOS interface,
-passing along any extra data to be interpreted by the operating system
-as desired.

-4.2 BIOS device mapping techniques
-==================================
-
-Both of these techniques should be usable from any PC operating system,
-and neither require any special support in the drivers themselves. This
-section will be flushed out into detailed explanations, particularly for
-the I/O restriction technique.
-
-   The general rule is that the data comparison technique is the quick
-and dirty solution. It works most of the time, but doesn't cover all the
-bases, and is relatively simple.
-
-   The I/O restriction technique is much more complex, but it has
-potential to solve the problem under all conditions, plus allow access
-of the remaining BIOS devices when not all of them have operating system
-drivers.

-
-4.2.1 Data comparison technique
--------------------------------
-
-Before activating _any_ of the device drivers, gather enough data from
-similar sectors on each of the disks such that each one can be uniquely
-identified.
-
-   After activating the device drivers, compare data from the drives
-using the operating system drivers. This should hopefully be sufficient
-to provide such a mapping.
-
-   Problems:
-
-  1. The data on some BIOS devices might be identical (so the part
-     reading the drives from the BIOS should have some mechanism to give
-     up).
-
-  2. There might be extra drives not accessible from the BIOS which are
-     identical to some drive used by the BIOS (so it should be capable
-     of giving up there as well).
-
-
-File: multiboot.info,  Node: I/O restriction technique,  Prev: Data comparison technique,  Up: BIOS device mapping techniques
-
-4.2.2 I/O restriction technique
--------------------------------
-
-This first step may be unnecessary, but first create copy-on-write
-mappings for the device drivers writing into PC RAM. Keep the original
-copies for the "clean BIOS virtual machine" to be created later.
-
-   For each device driver brought online, determine which BIOS devices
-become inaccessible by:
-
-  1. Create a "clean BIOS virtual machine".
-
-  2. Set the I/O permission map for the I/O area claimed by the device
-     driver to no permissions (neither read nor write).
-
-  3. Access each device.
-
-  4. Record which devices succeed, and those which try to access the
-     "restricted" I/O areas (hopefully, this will be an "xor"
-     situation).
-
-   For each device driver, given how many of the BIOS devices were
-subsumed by it (there should be no gaps in this list), it should be easy
-to determine which devices on the controller these are.
-
-   In general, you have at most 2 disks from each controller given BIOS
-numbers, but they pretty much always count from the lowest logically
-numbered devices on the controller.

-4.3 Example OS code
-===================
-
-In this distribution, the example Multiboot kernel `kernel' is
-included. The kernel just prints out the Multiboot information structure
-on the screen, so you can make use of the kernel to test a
-Multiboot-compliant boot loader and for reference to how to implement a
-Multiboot kernel. The source files can be found under the directory
-`docs' in the GRUB distribution.
-
-   The kernel `kernel' consists of only three files: `boot.S',
-`kernel.c' and `multiboot.h'. The assembly source `boot.S' is written
-in GAS (*note GNU assembler: (as.info)Top.), and contains the Multiboot
-information structure to comply with the specification. When a
-Multiboot-compliant boot loader loads and execute it, it initialize the
-stack pointer and `EFLAGS', and then call the function `cmain' defined
-in `kernel.c'. If `cmain' returns to the callee, then it shows a
-message to inform the user of the halt state and stops forever until
-you push the reset key. The file `kernel.c' contains the function
-`cmain', which checks if the magic number passed by the boot loader is
-valid and so on, and some functions to print messages on the screen.
-The file `multiboot.h' defines some macros, such as the magic number
-for the Multiboot header, the Multiboot header structure and the
-Multiboot information structure.

-4.3.4 Other Multiboot kernels
------------------------------
-
-Other useful information should be available in Multiboot kernels, such
-as GNU Mach and Fiasco `http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/'. And, it
-is worth mentioning the OSKit
-`http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/oskit/', which provides a library

-4.4 Example boot loader code
-============================
-
-The GNU GRUB (*note GRUB: (grub.info)Top.) project is a full
-Multiboot-compliant boot loader, supporting all required and optional
-features present in this specification. A public release has not been
-made, but the test release is available from:
-
-   `ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub'
-
-   See the webpage `http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html', for
-more information.
