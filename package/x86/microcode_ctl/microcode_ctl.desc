[I] Intel Microcode Update Utility

[T] The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode driver
[T] written by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@veritas.com>. The utility has two uses:
[T]
[T] * it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to be uploaded
[T]   to Intel IA32 processors. (Pentium Pro, PII, PIII, Pentium 4, Celeron,
[T]   Xeon etc - all P6 and above, which does NOT include pentium classics).
[T]   It also supports processors of the x86_64 architecture.
[T] * it signals the kernel driver to release any buffers it may hold 
[T]
[T] The microcode update is volatile and needs to be uploaded on each system
[T] boot i.e. it doesn't reflash your cpu permanently, reboot and it reverts
[T] back to the old microcode.
