[I] nice configurable jogdial menu with brightness and volume control for X

[T] S-Jog is a program that uses the Sony Vaio laptops Jog Wheel to do various
[T] things:
[T]     * Launch applications
[T]     * Adjust screen brightness
[T]     * Adjust volume
[T]     * Act like a mousewheel
[T] S-Jog pops up when you click the Jog Wheel then disappears after 3 seconds 
[T] of idle time. The mousewheel feature is turned on when S-Jog is hidden.
