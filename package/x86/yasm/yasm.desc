[I] A complete rewrite of the NASM assembler

[T] Yasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the "new" BSD License
[T] (some portions are under other licenses, see COPYING for details). It is
[T] designed from the ground up to allow for multiple assembler syntaxes to be
[T] supported (eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object
[T] formats and even multiple instruction sets. Another primary module of the
[T] overall design is an optimizer module.
