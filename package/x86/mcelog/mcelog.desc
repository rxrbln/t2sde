[I] A user space backend for logging machine check errors

[T] mcelog is the user space backend for logging machine check errors
[T] reported by the hardware to the kernel. The kernel does the immediate
[T] actions (like killing processes etc.) and mcelog decodes the errors
[T] and manages various other advanced error responses like
[T] offlining memory, CPUs or triggering events.
[T] 
[T] It primarily handles machine checks and thermal events, which
[T] are reported for errors detected by the CPU.
