[I] X86 CPU stress test

[T] These programs are designed to load x86 CPUs as heavily as possible for
[T] the purposes of system testing.  They have been optimized for different
[T] processors.  FPU and ALU instructions are coded an assembler endless loop.
[T] They do not test every instruction.  The goal has been to maximize heat
[T] production from the CPU, putting stress on the CPU itself, cooling
[T] system, motherboard (especially voltage regulators) and power supply
[T] (likely cause of burnBX/MMX errors).
[T] 
[T] burnP5   is optimized for Intel Pentium w&w/o MMX processors
[T] burnP6   is for Intel PentiumPro, PentiumII&III and Celeron CPUs
[T] burnK6   is for AMD K6 processors
[T] burnK7   is for AMD Athlon/Duron processors
[T] burnMMX  is to test cache/memory interfaces on all CPUs with MMX
[T] burnBX   is an alternate cache/memory test for Intel CPUs
[T]
[T] cpuburn  is a shell wrapper for easy use of this applications
