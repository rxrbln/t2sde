[I] Research and manipulation API for Biblical texts

[T] The SWORD Engine is a software framework that allows research
[T] manipulation of Biblical texts. There are a number of projects that
[T] use The SWORD Engine, including Bibletime, GnomeSword, and The SWORD
[T] Project for Windows. Many of these projects already include The SWORD
[T] Engine in their distribution, so only download if you were instructed
[T] to do so, or are a software developer wishing to develop Bible
[T] software.
