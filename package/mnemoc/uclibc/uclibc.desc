[I] A C library for embedded Linux systems.

[T] uClibc is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems. It is much
[T] smaller then the GNU C Library, but nearly all applications supported by 
[T] glibc also work perfectly with uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to
[T] uClibc typically involves just recompiling the source code. uClibc even 
[T] supports shared libraries and threading. It currently runs on standard 
[T] Linux and MMU-less Linux (also known as &amp;micro;Clinux) systems with
[T] support for ARM, i386, h8300, m68k, MIPS, mipsel, PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and
[T] v850 processors.
