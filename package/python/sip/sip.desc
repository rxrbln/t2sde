[I] Tool to create Python bindings for C and C++ 

[T] SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings 
[T] for C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed to create 
[T] PyQt, the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to 
[T] create bindings for any C or C++ library.
