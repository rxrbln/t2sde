[I] The Python specializing compiler.

[T] Psyco shows that it is possible to execute Python code at
[T] speeds approaching that of fully compiled languages, by using
[T] a technique called "specialization".
[T] This extension module for the unmodified interpreter accelerates
[T] user programs with little or no change in their sources.
[T] It can increase speed by a factor that can be very interesting,
[T] and an increase of 2 to 10 times is common.
