[I] A framework for developing graphical applications in Python and PyGTK

[T] Kiwi is an object-oriented framework for developing graphical
[T] applications using Python. It has a set of classes that provide
[T] a solid application architecture, and a set of high level
[T] graphical components that can be used as drop-in replacements
[T] for some of the widgets in PyGTK, including CList, CTree, Label,
[T] OptionMenu, and more. It includes a complete developer's manual,
[T] with examples and screenshots, and full API documentation.
