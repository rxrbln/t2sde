[I] Python library for creating PEG parsers

[T] The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing
[T] simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of
[T] regular expressions. The pyparsing module provides a library of classes
[T] that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in Python code.
