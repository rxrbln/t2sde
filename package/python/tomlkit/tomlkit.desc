[I] Style preserving TOML library

[T] TOML Kit is a 1.0.0-compliant TOML library. It includes a parser that
[T] preserves all comments, indentations, whitespace and internal element
[T] ordering, and makes them accessible and editable via an intuitive API. You
[T] can also create new TOML documents from scratch using the provided helpers.
[T] Part of the implementation has been adapted, improved and fixed from Molten.
