[I] Zephyr’s meta-tool

[T] West’s built-in commands provide a multiple repository management system
[T] with features inspired by Google’s Repo tool and Git submodules. West is
[T] also “pluggable”: you can write your own west extension commands which
[T] add additional features to west. Zephyr uses this to provide conveniences
[T] for building applications, flashing and debugging them, and more.
