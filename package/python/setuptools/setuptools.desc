[I] A collection of enhancements to the Python distutils

[T] Packages built and distributed using setuptools look to the user like
[T] ordinary Python packages based on the distutils. Your users don't need to
[T] install or even know about setuptools in order to use them, and you don't
[T] have to include the entire setuptools package in your distributions. By
[T] including just a single bootstrap module (a 7K .py file), your package
[T] will automatically download and install setuptools if the user is building
[T] your package from source and doesn't have a suitable version already
[T] installed.
