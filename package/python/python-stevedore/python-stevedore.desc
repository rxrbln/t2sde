[I] Manage dynamic plugins for Python applications

[T] Stevedore avoids creating yet another extension mechanism by building on
[T] top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing entry points tends to be
[T] repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager classes for implementing
[T] common patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.
