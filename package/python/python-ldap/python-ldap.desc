[I] LDAP API for Python

[T] python-ldap provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP directory
[T] servers from Python programs. Mainly it wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x libs
[T] for that purpose.
[T] Additionally the package contains modules for other LDAP-related stuff
[T] (e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs, LDAPv3 schema, etc.).
