[I] Python/PostgreSQL database adapter

[T] psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
[T] language. It is an almost complete rewrite of psycopg. It still supports
[T] all the features of psycopg but add real adaptation for Python to
[T] PostgreSQL type conversions, asynchronous queries, support for the
[T] Python built-in datetime module and the new (Python 2.4) Decimal type.
[T] Its main advantages are that it supports the full Python DBAPI 2.0 and
[T] it is thread safe at level 2. It was designed for heavily multi-threaded
[T] applications that create and destroy lots of cursors and make a conspicuous
[T] number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs. The psycopg distribution includes
[T] ZPsycopgDA, a Zope Database Adapter.
