[T] Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within
[T] the server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in
[T] Python that will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have
[T] access to advanced features such as ability to retain database connections
[T] and other data between hits and access to Apache internals.
