[I] Virtual Analogue Matrix Synthesizer

[T] BacteriuM is a non-realtime software only simulation of an analogue
[T] sounding synthesizer featuring:
[T]
[T] * 6 Oscillators
[T] * 6 classic ADSR envelope generators (one for each oscillator)
[T] * 6 ADSR frequency-envelope-generators (one for each oscillator)
[T] * 6x6 modulation matrix (any oscillator can modulate any other oscillator)
[T] * ring modulation 
[T] * ring demodulation 
[T] * amplitude modulation 
[T] * frequency modulation 
[T] * hard sync
[T] * phase modulation
[T] * pulsewith modulation
[T] * simulation of 24 dB Butterworth LP/HP with resonance
[T] * sample and hold
[T] * chorus 
[T] * delay 
[T] * overdrive 
[T] * phaser
[T] * WAV-Output
[T]
[T] BacteriuM itself has no GUI. Instead the synth configuration is written
[T] to a configuration file which can be 'compiled' to the wav output file.
[T]
[T] However - this package also includes the 'bacterium_gui' program which
[T] can be used for creating *.synth files and running BacteriuM over them.
