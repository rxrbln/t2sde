[I] FLTK (pronounced "fulltick")

[T] FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a LGPL'd C++ graphical user interface
[T] toolkit for X (UNIX®), OpenGL, and WIN32 (Microsoft® Windows® NT
[T] 4.0, 95, or 98). It is currently maintained by a small group of
[T] developers across the world with a central repository in the US.
[T]
[T] FLTK was originally created to build in-house applications at Digital
[T] Domain for image processing and 3D graphics. The original author,
[T] Bill Spitzak, received permission from Digital Domain to release
[T] it to the public domain in the hopes that it could be used to make
[T] better, faster, and nicer-looking UNIX programs. Digital Domain
[T] has since withdrawn support for FLTK, but Bill is still able to
[T] work on it from time to time.
