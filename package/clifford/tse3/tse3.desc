[I] The TSE3 Library

[T] TSE3 is a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. It is a
[T] 'sequencer engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of
[T] a sequencer but provides no form of user interface. Sequencer applications
[T] or multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries
[T] to provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.
[T]
[T] TSE3 is a mature library based on a lot of experience. Whilst not
[T] providing the user interface, it provides a lot of assistance to a UI,
[T] attempting to provide as much funcitonality as possible in as generic a
[T] manner as possible.
