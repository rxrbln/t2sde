SDECFG_X86_OPT
  Please select the specific type of x86-CPU you want to optimise
  binaries for.
  You can also choose to not optimise for any specific CPU. The resulting
  binaries will run on any x86-compatible CPU but with a significant loss
  in performance.

SDECFG_X86_OPT_XEN
  Enables certain optimizations for maximal run-time performance inside
  the Xen hypervisor.
