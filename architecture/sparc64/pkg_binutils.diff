As GCC, we want the the linker to use elf32 by default, otherwise we would
have to patch packages like mozilla* or exact-image (and potentially other
exact-build based packages) that assume they can "pre"-link objects using
"ld -r". Of course the linker should accept the the default compiler output,
by default as well.
