SDECFG_SPARC64_OPT
  Please select the CPU you want to optimise for.

SDECFG_SPARC64_32BIT
  Despie the instability of the pure 64bit user-space it also has a
  performance hit, since the poor old Ultra SPARC CPUs have to suffle
  even more data around ... This option - enabled by default - will
  instruct the build system to default to 32bit for the user-space
  applications. This is also the only way to run X on SPARC/Linux
  right now. If unsure say yes.
