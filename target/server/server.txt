TODO:
- package selection: at the moment it is more a package deslection - maybe 
  we should add a better approach to select specific packages
- configuration: build a config system to do a automatic 
  installation/upgrade of a server based on a simple config-file/dir
- test all packages
- add a basic configuration for default services like apache, php, exim, 
  ldap, samba, ...
