* rootfs/home/archivista must be chown'ed (since owner:group is not versioned)
* rootfs/etc/{passwd,shadow} as well as rootfs/sbin/init.d/system should
  be patched rather than replaced (so later fixes propagate nicely)

  ln -s, patch and so on data in rootfs - new function like copy_parse_from ...

* serpnp.init
* auto swap init
* xconfig init
* run more than ldconfig in before squashing - e.g. fccache and friends ...

* gdm config / auto login

* archivista files
  - packages
  - db
  - backup
  - init
  - ...
  - grub theme
  - gdm theme
