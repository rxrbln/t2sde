1st stage boot disk (initrd)
============================

An initrd disk is loaded from whereever (this not important at this point
since it is done by the boot loader before booting the kernel).

The linuxrc program is statically linked (with dietlibc?) and does the
following:

  * Mount /proc and /dev.

  * Allow loading kernel modules which are present on the initrd disk.

  * Configure network interfaces if present.

  * Configure installation source with 2nd stage root filesystem.

  * Load the 2nd stage system to /dev/ram1 (and others?)

  * Write new root filesystem specs to /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev.

  * Umount /proc and /dev.

  * Exit and let the kernel do the rest.

The user interaction must be done without depending on any terminal
capabilities.

For loading kernel modules, the tool 'insmod' is also stored on the initrd
image (re-implementing insmod in linuxrc would be too complicated).
