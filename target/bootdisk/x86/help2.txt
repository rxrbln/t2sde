Installation on systems with less than 64MB of RAM:

To load the ramdisk for the 2nd stage installation you nead arround
20MB of RAM. It can also be loaded on small sized memory systems when
a swap partition is available. If you already have partitionized the
disk you can activate it in the first stage program using the option
"Activate already formatted swap device".

If you need to partitionize your disk you can load a very small ram-
disk ("2nd_stage_small") to perform initial configuration such as
partitionizing the disk, and then reboot to choose the normal 2nd_
stage file for installation.
