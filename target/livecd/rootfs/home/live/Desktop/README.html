<H1>T2 @Live</H1>

<H3>What is this?</H3>

<p>This is the <a href="http://www.t2-project.org/">T2 SDE</a>
(System Development Environment)
<a href="http://www.t2-project.org/live/">Live CD</a>.</p>

<H3>What is the root password?</H3>

<p>Since having a default password is very unsecure if the box is connected
to a network and services are started (such as ssh, http, ftp, ...) the Live
CD does not allow root login by default. The only login allowed is the
password-less "live" account.</p>

<p>In order to gain root privileges run use sudo:</p>

<PRE> 
sudo bash --login 
</PRE>

<p>Once root you can of course enable the account by seting a password
(via passwd).</p>

<p>We strongly recomment to set a live password when you start remote
services such as ssh, http, ... or work for a longer time in the live
system:</p>

<PRE>
passwd 
</PRE>
