1) Preface
~~~~~~~~~~

Hi, this here is a small howto build the dietlibc target. I hope that it
will be some time no more needed because the target will be so
strateforward. Currently it is more a draft for a howto but who cares it
is more then nothing, right ? ;-)

Some pretty internal stuff is in Documentation/Developers/TODO . There
are also current problems and bugs put together so even if you are not a
developer you probably would like to read it. 

The target is currently experimental, so be carefull because it can kill
your pet, make your mother angry, make you sleepless or simply not work
and/or compile.

2) What is dietlibc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dietlibc is a small alternative libc. In contrary to glibc it is not so
bloated so it is very useful for embedded systems or installation disks
where space is very expensive.

Dietlibc is still under heavy development. There are many bugs that
shall be fixed. But it is functional enough to try build a system based
fully on dietlibc. (Someone has to start with it ;-) ) We will get this
baby running helping the dietlibc developers find bugs in their child.
;-)

3) Prepare for the build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to install dietlibc. You can use the source that is being
downloaded by rocklinux (you can find it in
download/base/dietlibc/dietlibc-$ver.tar.bz2) or get it from
http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/ 

The next step is to replace the cc command with a script that runs gcc
with prepended diet wrapper. For this run this commands:

# mv /usr/bin/cc /usr/bin/cc.bak
# vi /usr/bin/cc

And insert the following code it the file:

#!/bin/sh
exec diet gcc "$@"

Then you have to change the rights for the shell script:

# chmod +x /usr/bin/cc

That is all that you need to do to start with the compile process of
dietlibc target.

4) Build
~~~~~~~~

Do the same what is described in Documentation/Build apropriatly
selecting dietlibc target in scripts/Config .

Please disable the "Create cache files after packages have been built"
option in the expert section of scripts/Config . It is not working
AFAIK.

That should be all.
