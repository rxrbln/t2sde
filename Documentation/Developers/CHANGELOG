# With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick     #
# vines that grow in the swamp until he reaches the Dagobah statistics     #
# lab. Panting heavily, he continues his exercises -- grepping,            #
# installing new packages, logging in as root, and writing replacements    #
# for two-year-old shell scripts in Python.                                #
#                                                                          #
# YODA: Code! Yes. A programmer's strength flows from code                 #
# maintainability. But beware of Perl. Terse syntax...more than one way    #
# to do it...default variables. The dark side of code maintainability      #
# are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you when code you write. If    #
# once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your         #
# destiny, consume you it will.                                            #
#                                                                          #
# LUKE: Is Perl better than Python?                                        #

# YODA: No... no... no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.                   #
#                                                                          #
# LUKE: But how will I know why Python is better than Perl?                #
#                                                                          #
# YODA: You will know. When your code you try to read six months from now. #
#                                                                          #
