The following hooks which may be extended using hook_add() from parse-config
files are available (see 'man' and 'ccache' parse-config files for examples):

	prepare
	prepatch
	postpatch
	postdoc
	preconf
	premake
	inmake
	postmake
	postflist
	postinstall
	finish

They always contain an entry for the equally named variable (which has a
description in PKG-BUILD-VARS) with priority '5'.

See calls to hook_eval() in Build-Pkg if you want to know when the hooks
are executed.
