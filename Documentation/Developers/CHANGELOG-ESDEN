This is a changelog for Dietlibc-Target, Alpha Target and all changes esden
does for ROCKLinux ;-)

*) 2003-09-04 (2.0.0-rc1 - 2.0.0-rc2)
 - added vim to dietlibc target
 - refixed util-linux package for dietlibc
 - added isofs.txt file creation to dietlibc target

*) 2003-09-03 (2.0.0-rc1 - 2.0.0-rc2)
 - fixed scripts/Build-Tools so that it does not execute backup parse-config
   files marked with ~ at the end of filename
 - modified package/base/dietlibc/parse-config-9 so that it patches gcc to use
   dietlibc as default c library
 - fixed zlib, findutils, curl for dietlibc
 - removed obsolated e2fsprogs dietlibc related patch
 - fixed gcc3 for dietlibc making it shared/static aware and disabling c++,
   java support when compiled with dietlibc. C++ needs further investigation
   because it seems that it is fixable, but I postpone it for later.
 - fixed coreutils and bison in stage 3 of dietlibc target. Somehow they are
   hanging when trying to compile in doc subdirectory. Needs further
   investigation...
 - fixed util-linux under dietlibc without adding tons of headers to dietlibc
   include directory!
 - removed the DIETLIBC flag form syslinux and inserted addition of it in
   target/bootdisk/config.in where it should be
 - removed the DIETLIBC flag from memtest86 and bonnie++ because they are not
   compiling with dietlibc yet and need more work (in bootdisk target they are
   selected "manually" with config.in)
 - grep is also hanging in doc directory in dietbuild so patched
 - fixed cpio for dietlibc adding a patch and adding texinfo, ncurses to
   dietlibc target (in the same run fixed ncurses for dietlibc (disabled c++
   api))
 - fixed net-tools for dietlibc

*) 2003-08-18 (2.0.0-camp - 2.0.0-rc1)
 - fixed Task #38: sshd: issue a error if no keys are present on startup with a
   reference how to create the keys.

*) 2003-08-17 (2.0.0-camp - 2.0.0-rc1)
 - fixed Task #67: stone: no dialog installed
 - fixed a typo in packages/base/dietlibc/parse-config-9
 - added DIETLIBC flag to zlib

*) 2003-08-15 (2.0.0-camp - 2.0.0-rc1)
 - cleaned up the sshd init script see Task #38 in flyspray

*) 2003-08-01 (2.0.0-beta7 - 2.0.0-rc1)
 - added dvorakng package

*) 2003-07-30 (2.0.0-beta7 - 2.0.0-rc1)
 - added socket package
 - updated cksum for services file
 - added tetradraw package

*) 2003-07-26 (2.0.0-beta7 - 2.0.0-rc1)
 - added ekg (gadu-gadu) package
 - changed from the outdated and crappy atstake version to the gnu version
 - cleaned up Create-SrcTar script

*) 2003-04-19 (2.0.0-alpha - 2.0.0-beta)

 - fixed Build-Tools to not use parse-config*~ files
 - added netcat package to esden repository
 - added prefix_WRAPPER_APPEND_PO option to the command wrapper that is adding
   an option before other wrappers are being run (needed for -lcompat in
   dietlibc target)
 - fixed coreutils, sed and curl in dietlibc target
 - removed gcc2 from the dietlibc target because that package is not building
   and to honest not nessesary for this target ...
 - set DISABLE_NLS in dietlibc target (localization is not supported by
   dietlibc yet)
