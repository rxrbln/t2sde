This is a changelog for Dietlibc-Target, Alpha Target and all changes esden
does for ROCKLinux ;-)

*) 2003-04-19 (2.0.0-alpha - 2.0.0-beta)

 - fixed Build-Tools to not use parse-config*~ files
 - added netcat package to esden repository
 - added prefix_WRAPPER_APPEND_PO option to the command wrapper that is adding
   an option before other wrappers are being run (needed for -lcompat in
   dietlibc target)
 - fixed coreutils, sed and curl in dietlibc target
 - removed gcc2 from the dietlibc target because that package is not building
   and to honest not nessesary for this target ...
 - set DISABLE_NLS in dietlibc target (localization is not supported by
   dietlibc yet)
