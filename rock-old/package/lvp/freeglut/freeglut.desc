[I] An OpenSourced clone of the GLUT library.

[T] freeglut is intended to be a 100% plug-compatible 
[T] clone, and is released under the Xfree license. The 
[T] GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) is a widely used 
[T] library for doing window control, keyboard, and 
[T] mouse input, and other basic functions for OpenGL 
[T] programs. However, GLUT is not OpenSourced - 
[T] although it's source code is available under a 
[T] somewhat ill-defined set of restrictions. 
[T] Hence, 'freeglut'.
