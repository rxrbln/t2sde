Todos and Ideas:

 - Add Targets: Benchmark/HW-Tester
 - Something like a watchdog-timer for stalled package builds
 - Fix -fstack-protector for glibc (currently it's simply disabled)
 - Append architecture to binary packages?
 - Add an FHS-checker to 00-dirtree (using 'postinstall' hook)?
 - lcap has a broken URL and seams to be disapared from the net.

Dependencies to be analyzed:
 - python .pyc files
 - samba depends on valgrind

 - stone mkfs fail / reiserfs for example
 - stoen rock config id
 - scrollkeeper
 - improve grub stone module usability
 - check stage 0 ccache and add optimizations, compiler and dlibrary to the
   directory name
 - build gcc components in sperate packages (c++, java, f77 and co)
 - check if gcj is wrapped and possible to cache

 - do not run date to inject a possible bad line into etc/fonts/fonts.conf
 - xorg should not install a non-T2 xprint init script that is not functional


Notes live cd options:
 - acpi=off
 - memtest86
 - c press to get config menu
