Todos and Ideas:

 - Add Targets: Benchmark/HW-Tester
 - Something like a watchdog-timer for stalled package builds
 - Fix -fstack-protector for glibc (currently it's simply disabled)
 - Append architecture to binary packages?
 - Add an FHS-checker to 00-dirtree (using 'postinstall' hook)?
 - lcap has a broken URL and seams to be disapared from the net.
 - refactor the architecture boot code from the bootdisk to the
   architecture subdir - so the mulitple targets can utilize the
   code
