ROCK Linux Todos and Ideas:

 - Add Targets: ROCK Router Linux, Benchmark/HW-Tester
 - Something like a watchdog-timer for stalled package builds
 - lcd (lcdproc) support in build- and init-scripts (status messages)
 - install-disks: support multiple keyboards
 - Write ROCK Linux Hacking HowTo (writing packages and targets)
 - Fix -fstack-protector for glibc (currently it's simply disabled)
 - Append architecture to GEM packages
 - Add an FHS-checker to 00-dirtree (using 'postinstall' hook)
 - lcap has a broken URL and seams to be disapared from the net.
 - refactor the architecture boot code from the bootdisk to the
   architecture subdir - so the mulitple targets can utilize the
   code
 - dietlibc target problems and ideas
 	- net-tools related problems
 		- fix fddi support
		- fix ipv6 support
	- add strptime support to dietlibc so that tune2fs and some
	  other programms compile fully and correctly
	- ask for locale support in dietlibc so that for example cal
	  compiles (there surely are others) ;-) (cal currently compiles
	  due to a bad hack from Olaf)
	- find out why "Plan A" of patch does not work on dietlibc (-x 16 
	  switch for patch in scripts/Create-Pkg)
	- add perl to the target. textutils needs it :-/
	- reanable man generation in textutils
	- the gcc version compiled with dietlibc has problems with the
	  -pipe option. When you use this option then you get linker errors.
	  It is a very strange problem because it is not always there. 
	  Sometimes the compile succeeds. The errors you get are also mostly 
	  random. I hope I will find the source of the problem. (Esden)
