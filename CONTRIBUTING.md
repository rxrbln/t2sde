# Contributing to T2 Docker Multi-Arch Build System

Thank you for contributing to this project.  
This setup aims to provide a reproducible, minimal, and extensible environment for building T2 SDE across multiple architectures using Docker and QEMU.

# 🧠 Project principles

Before contributing, please understand the core goals:

- Keep the system **minimal and reproducible**
- Respect the **native T2 build workflow**
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction
- Ensure **cross-architecture support remains optional, not mandatory**
- Prefer clarity over complexity
