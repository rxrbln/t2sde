Documentation of the package description tags format. This tags are used in
the *.desc files. If you want to add additional tags, their names have to start
with 'X-' (like [X-FOOBAR]).

Please use the tags in the same order as they are listed in this file. Add
a blank line wherever a '--' is found here and use the X-* flags after all
the other tags. "scripts/Create-DescPatch" can help you here.

All tags marked with (*) are required, and should be present in every .desc
file. All tags marked with (1) may only occure once.

[SRC] [SOURCEPACKAGE] (1)

  Format: [SRC] tarball1 tarball2
  This will enable build_this_package to build the content of more than
  one tarball.
  NOTE: do not put the extension of the tarballs (e.g. tar.gz) into this 
    tag, as it will be autodetected.
  NOTE2: a pattern to match the needed tarball should be enough.
    (example:
    > [D] cksum mypkg-version1.tar.gz http://some.url.tld
    > [D] cksum mypkg-gfx-version2.tbz2 http://some.url.tld
    > [D] cksum mypkg-data-version3.tar.bz2 http://some.url.tld
    > [SRC] mypkg-version1 gfx
    This would run the whole build cycle with mypkg-version1.tar.bz2 and 
    mypkg-gfx-version2.tbz2 but not with mypkg-data-version3.tar.bz2.
