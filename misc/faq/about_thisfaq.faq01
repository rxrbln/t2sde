Q: What is this FAQ

This FAQ is mostly covering installing and using a ROCK Linux based
distribution which is build with the default-settings.

So the distribution you are using might be entirely diffrent from what we
do cover here. Most special-purpose distributions (like single-floppy systems)
do belong to this category (such special distributions are called `targets'
in ROCK Linux).

An extra section in this FAQ is just handling those targets.
