# Given are builds without stage 9 in which broken packages
# have been rebuilt unless all deps are resolved.
#
# This script is trying to resolve all cyclic deps causing
# troubles in scripts/Check-Deps-2 by looking into the dep
# files from the given builds and adding del entries to
# scripts/dep_fixes.txt for those of the cyclic deps present
# in scripts/dep_db.txt but not in the given builds deps.
#
# So you can do stuff like:
#
# while ./depfeedback.sh build/ref06* >> scripts/dep_fixes.txt; do true; done
