# Written by Benjamin Schieder <blindcoder@scavenger.homeip.net>
# Modified by Juergen Sawinski <jsaw@gmx.net> to create
# a package based on freshmeat info
#
# Use:
# newpackage.sh [-main] <rep>/<pkg> <freshmeat package name>
#
# will create <pkg>.desc and <pkg>.conf. .desc will contain the [D] and [COPY]
# already filled in. The other tags are mentioned with TODO.
#
# .conf will contain an empty <pkg>_main() { } and custmain="<pkg>_main"
# if -main is specified.
